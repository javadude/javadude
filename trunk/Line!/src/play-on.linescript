!ACT I
-5-
(_Curtain rises on the not-quite-furnished set of the play-within-the-play, "Murder Most Foul It looks as pictured in the "play setting" diagram in this script, but the sofa and armchair, right now, are represented by folding chairs, three for the sofa and one for the armchair, and the Upstage corridor wall is not yet in place, so that we can see the theatre wall itself through the Upstage doorway, and any "backstage clutter" one might normally see in such a place-a ladder, a sawhorse, buckets of paint and brushes, etc. Other accouterments of the set, however, are as they will appear in. the play-within-the-play when it is finally given. [Players in this act will wear casual rehearsal clothing.] [NOTE: A seat in the front row, in the Downstage Right area, should be reserved for _GERRY _for all performances, of course.] At curtain-rise, _AGGIE MANVILLE _is onstage, watching the curtain open, warily, as a stage manager should._)
AGGIE. (_Calls Offstage._) Okay, hold it, that's fine! (_Curtain stops, and she peers out into audience._) Gerry? How's that?
GERRY. (_From rear of theatre._) Where's the upstage corridor wall? Aggie, I thought I told you- (_She will walk down aisle to front edge of stage, during :_)
AGGIE. It was too wobbly. They're putting on a couple more braces.
-6-
GERRY. (_Will come into our view; she is _GERALDINE DUNBAR, _the director; middle-aged and pleasant-looking._) I hope they don't make 'em too bulky-our people have to be able to cross backstage _behind _that thing!
AGGIE. (_Shrugs._) That's what I _told _them. All we need is somebody breaking a leg.
GERRY. Where are our players?
AGGIE. (_Jerks a thumb Offstage._) Going over their lines. You want 'em?
GERRY. Of course I want them! It's only three days till dress rehearsal! We've got to get this show moving!
AGGIE. (_Calls._) Hey! Onstage, everybody!
(_Through various doors there will wander in: _HENRY and POLLY BENISH, _a couple in their middle 50s; _MARLA "SMITTY" SMITH, _a pretty-but-awkward girl of about 17; _SAUL WATSON, _a thin, mustachioed man of about 45; _BILLY CAREWE, _an athletic-looking young man of spirit, about 25; _VIOLET IMBRY, _a pretty face behind which medical science may someday discover a pretty brain, about 22; and _LOUISE PEARY, _a sad-faced woman in plaid flannel shirt and denims, carrying a roll of gaffer's tape, about 35; ALL save _LOUISE _are carrying 9"x12" binders containing scripts for their play; the _BENISHES _will, sit upon the sofa, the others will remain standing [NOTE: For this act, "sofa" and "armchair" refer to the folding-chair substitutes for these items.]_)
GERRY. Louise, don't you have any work to do?
LOUISE. (_Defensively-but-pessimistically, as she nearly always speaks._) Aggie said everybody.
AGGIE. I didn't mean you.
LOUISE. I'm somebody.
-7-
GERRY. Everybody in the _play, _Louise.
LOUISE. She shoulda said so. (_Exits the way she came in._)
GERRY. Now, is everybody here?
VIOLET. Not counting Louise.
GERRY. I know, Violet, I know.
POLLY. _Can _we get _on _with the _rehearsal?_
(_Before anyone can reply, we hear the sound of HAMMERING from the direction in which _LOUISE _vanished._)
HENRY. Does she have to do that _now!_
GERRY. Louise!
LOUISE. (_Off. Hammering stops._) What?
GERRY. Do you have to do that _now_?
LOUISE. (_Off._) You want that corridor wall or don't you?!
GERRY. Isn't there anything _else _you can work on?!
LOUISE. (_Off._) I guess.
GERRY. Good. (_Gets command of herself._) Now, ladies and gentlemen, let us take the action from the top of Act Three. We've wasted enough time already.
POLLY. _I've _been ready for half an _hour!_
BILLY. Who _hasn't?!_
GERRY. I'm sorry I was late. We've only got the one car, and Frank had to work late-
SAUL. You should've called _me - _I go right by your place, Gerry.
SMITTY. Saul picks _me _up for _every_ rehearsal.
BILLY. (_Kidding _SAUL) Does Margie know that?
SAUL. Aw, c'mon, Billy! Can't have Smitty coming by bicycle after dark.
GERRY. People, can we have these charming conversations later? We've got to get this _show _rehearsed!
POLLY. That's what I've been saying all along! Haven't I, Henry
-8-
HENRY. Yes, dear.
GERRY. Polly, we're all as anxious as you are. This is a first play, by a new author, and we want to do it justice.
SAUL. Justice tempered with Mercy.
POLLY. _I _happen to think it's _a lovely _play!
SAUL. Sure. You've got the fattest part!
POLLY. How dare you?
HENRY. Darling, he means you have the most _lines!_
POLLY. I know _very well _what he meant!
GERRY. (_A bit stridently._) Might I remind you all that the author will be here at dress rehearsal-and we _still _haven't learned the third act?! (_ALL grimace, and ad-lib mumbled apologies, and start getting into position, during:_) And what about those scripts?! We should have been off book two weeks ago!
(_Positions for the play-within-the-play will be: _HENRY _at the sideboard, _SAUL _before the safe but facing into the room, _POLLY _in the center of the sofa, _SMITTY _just out of sight and ready to enter through Stage Right doorway, _VIOLET _in armchair, and _BILLY _standing just Upstage of armchair [NOTE: These will always be the "top of Act Three" positions for the group.]_)
BILLY. (_Tosses script onto left third of sofa._) I know _my_ lines.
POLLY. (_Drops her script atop his._) And I know _mine._
GERRY. How about the rest of you? (_They ad-lib apologetic mumbles, but put scripts down._)
SMITTY. (_Off._) Should I come in?
GERRY. (_Moves back and sits in front row, on:_) As soon as I give the signal. All right, everybody-top of Act Three. . . . _Curtain!_
-9-
VIOLET. "Ah, Lord Dudley, you give the most charming parties-!"
(_And CURTAIN STARTS TO DESCEND; GERRY leaps up._)
GERRY. _Louise!_
LOUISE. (_Off. While CURTAIN continues to close._) What?
GERRY. Leave the damn curtain alone!
LOUISE. (_Off._) But you said-
GERRY. That was for the _players! _We're _starting _the act, not _ending _it!
(_CURTAIN pauses wherever it is, and starts reopening._)
LOUISE. (_Off._) I was only doing my job!
(_PLAYERS ad-lib mumbles as CURTAIN COMES FULL OPEN._)
GERRY. That's fine! Now leave it _alone, _Louise, okay?
LOUISE. (_Off._) Fine by me!
GERRY. (_Sinks into seat again._) Okay, everybody, from the top again!
VIOLET. (_After a pause._) Now!?
GERRY. Yes! Now!
VIOLET. (_A bit flustered._) "Ah, Lord Dudley, you give the most charming parties in the whole of England!"
HENRY. "You are too kind, Diana. A pity Sir Percival could not be here."
POLLY. "Do you know-I'm - _worried_ about Percival! He's never accepted an invitation to one of our parties and then not shown up-at least, not without sending word."
-10-
(_There is a silence; PLAYERS slowly look toward _BILLY.)
BILLY. Oh, is that _me_?
GERRY. I thought you _knew _your _lines, _Billy?! 
BILLY. I do! I just forgot where I'm supposed to say them.
POLLY. (_Stands up._) I can't stand it! He's doing this on purpose! I know he is!
GERRY. Polly, sit down! Billy, pay attention to the cues! Take it back a line, and start again!
VIOLET. Whose line _is _it?
AGGIE. Polly's.
GERRY. (_Just realizing._) Aggie! _Why _are you still onstage?
AGGIE. If I stay in the _wings, _I can't _hear them!_
GERRY. If you heard them, why didn't you throw Billy his line?!
AGGIE. Because you said not to throw them any lines unless they asked for them! I thought he was just pausing before speaking.
GERRY. All right, all right. Aggie, get the hell offstage! (AGGIE _will turn and exit, during :_) Everybody get back into positions. We'll take it from the top!
SMITTY. (Off.) Do we _have _to?!
GERRY. YES!
SMITTY. (_Off._) You don't have to yell.
GERRY. That's what _you_ think! (_Enforcing a calmness on her voice._) Now-shall we begin once again-? (_ALL PLAYERS mumble assent._) Good. Take it from the top. Violet, go ahead.
VIOLET. (_Composes herself; then:_) "Ah, Lord Dudley, you give the most charming parties in the whole of England!"
-11-
HENRY. "You are too kind, Diana. A pity Sir Percival could not be here."
POLLY. "Do you know-I'm _worried _about Percival! He's never accepted an invitation not to show up at one of our parties-" I mean-
GERRY. Go on, go on, go on!
POLLY. (_Recovering._) "-to one of our parties and then not shown up-at least, not without, sending word."
BILLY. "Ah, but Lady Margaret, he might have had motor trouble."
VIOLET. "Yes, indeed. I do hope _he _hasn't had an accident- !"
GERRY. No, no, no! That's "-he hasn't had an _accident!"_
VIOLET. That's what I _said!_
GERRY. You said, _"-he _hasn't had an accident!" As if someone else _did!_
VIOLET. Should we take it from the top?
POLLY. Oh, damn it!
SMITTY. (Off.) Come _on, _Violet!
VIOLET. All right. (_Back into character._) ". . . I do hope he hasn't had an accident. These roads can be treacherous at night."
SMITTY. (_Enters and curtseys to _HENRY.) "Begging your pardon, milord, but should we delay dinner any longer?"
HENRY. "Mmm-no, I think not. Can't wait for Percival forever." (_Moves toward _POLLY.) "Shall we, my dear?"
POLLY. (_Rises._) "I suppose so. But-don't you think someone should call Percival's flat and ascertain the reason for his absence?"
BILLY. (_Coming around armchair to take _VIOLET'S arm _as she rises._) "Do you know-that might be a sound idea. There is something distinctly odd about all of this."
-12-
VIOLET. "All of what, Billy?"
(_ALL PLAYERS sag, excepting VIOLET_.)
BILLY. Violet, you did it again!
VIOLET. Did what?
BILLY. Called me by my own name! I'm "Stephen"! "Stephen Sellers"! And you are "Diana Lassiter"! Is that so hard to remember?!
GERRY. Billy, do you _mind?!_
BILLY. What-? Oh, sorry, Gerry.
GERRY. Take it from Violet's line.
VIOLET. Okay. (_In character._) "All of what, Stephen?"
BILLY. (_Goes to speak, goes blank, sags, calls:_) _Line!_
AGGIE. (Off.) "This business about Percival and-"
BILLY. (_Interrupts._) Got it! (_In character._) "This business about Percival and the necklace. He _did _say he was bringing it tonight, Lady Margaret?"
POLLY. "Well, actually, I never spoke with him directly-but there was a message delivered this morning in the post."
SMITTY. "What, on Saint Swithin's Day?"
HENRY. "By Jove! Never thought of that.! Margaret -are you _certain _about that message?"
POLLY. "Why-come to think of it-no."
VIOLET. "You _didn't _receive a message?"
POLLY. "Oh, yes-I did-but now I wonder if it actually were from Percival !"
BILLY. "I should very much like to _see _that telegram!"
GERRY. (_Jumps _up.) No-no-no! You've jumped the lines!
BILLY. Oh! Sorry. Just .a moment-yeah, now I've got it. (_In character._) "But it did come by post?"
-13-
POLLY. "I-I assumed it had-but--"
HENRY. "Assumed? You mean, you didn't actually see it?
POLLY. "Why, no?'
VIOLET. "Then how did you know its con_tent_?"
GERRY. " _Con_tent !"
VIOLET. "-_con_tent?"
POLLY. "Why-Doctor Forbes told me what it had said."
(_PLAYERS look toward _SAUL.)
SAUL. "Is there any reason I shouldn't have?"
BILLY. "No, no, of course not, old chap. Only-if there was no delivery of the post, today, then how-?"
SAUL. "It was not a letter. It was a telegram."
BILLY. Uh-uh-
GERRY. _Now _you say that line! The one you jumped before!
BILLY. (_Into character._) "I should very much like to _see _that cablegram!"
AGGIE. (_Off._) _"Telegram"!_
BILLY. Oh, hell, what difference does it make?!
GERRY. None! But if Saul says "telegram," then _you_ say "telegram"!
SAUL. What do you mean, "if"?! I _always _say "telegram"!
POLLY. _I _don't give a hoot in hell _who _says_ what! _Can't we get _on _with this disaster?!
HENRY. If we'd get _through _the thing once, we could start _polishing _our _parts!_
POLLY. And when do we get the real furniture? These metal chairs are painful to work on!
SAUL. But they help you _polish_ your parts . . . 
POLLY. (_Incensed._) There! He doing it again!
GERRY.-Saul, will you stop with the jokes and buckle down to work?!
-14-
SAUL. I was just trying to ease the tension.
HENRY. Your jokes about Polly are _causing _the tension!
SAUL. Okay-okay, no more jokes. Now can we please get back to the play?!
(_Offstage HAMMERING starts again._)
GERRY. _Louise!_
(_HAMMERING stops._)
LOUISE. (_Off._) I thought I could get the job finished while nobody was working.
GERRY. We're about to _start _working!
LOUISE. (_Off._) Well, why didn't you _say_ so?! (We _hear CLUNK of dropped hammer._) I'm gonna make some coffee.
GERRY. _Fine_! (_Regains some control._) Now-please -everybody in position, and we'll pick it up at Billy's line, all right?
(_PLAYERS mumble assent; then:_)
BILLY. (_In character._) "I should very much like to _see _that telegram!"
SAUL. "Well-as a matter of fact-I don't have it. The message was phoned from the telegraph office."
BILLY. "Doris-have there been any telephone messages this evening?"
SAUL. "See here, you insolent young pup! Are you doubting my word?!"
POLLY. "Of course he isn't, Rex! Stephen, you should apologize to Doctor Forbes."
BILLY. "Oh, I shall. As soon as Doris answers my question."
-15-
(_As PLAYERS look toward _SMITTY, _there is a CRASH Backstage._)
POLLY. What was _that?_
AGGIE. (_Off._) Louise dropped the coffee-cup tray!
LOUISE. (_Off._) You bumped it out of my hands!
AGGIE. (Off.) The hell I did!
GERRY. Did anything break?
LOUISE. (Off.) I don't think so.
AGGIE. (_Off._) She bent one of the spoons.
LOUISE. (_Off._) That _was _bent!
GERRY. Ladies! Ladies! Can you hold it down, _please_!? (_Listens; silence; sighs in relief._) Okay, let's pick it up where we left off.
SMITTY. (_In character._) "No, sir."
BILLY. (_Wasn't ready._) What?
SMITTY. I said-
BILLY. I _know _what you said, I just wasn't ready for it.
GERRY. Go back to Billy's line and start again.
BILLY. Okay. Um . . . oh. "Oh, I shall. As soon as Doris answers my question."
SMITTY. "No, sir."
POLLY. "What, are you quite sure?"
SMITTY. "The telephone has been out of order since this afternoon, _mum_!"
GERRY. Wait, wait! Smitty, that's short for "madam" -it doesn't mean the _phone _was keeping mum!
SMITTY. Oh! Oh, _I _see! (_Back into character._) " . . . out of order since this _afternoon_, mum!"
BILLY. "Aha! And what do you say to _that, _Doctor Forbes?"
(_SAUL opens his mouth, then pauses, frowning._)
GERRY. Saul, that's your cue!
-16-
SAUL. Didn't we skip a page? This part is coming too early.
GERRY. Aggie-?
AGGIE. Wait a minute, I'm trying to find the place. What page are _you_ on?
GERRY. I left my script at home. I was so anxious to get the car, that as soon as Frank came in, I took right off without thinking about it.
AGGIE. (_Comes Onstage, holding script._) You know, I think Saul's right-we go right from page three-two to page three-four. Who's got a complete script?
(_PLAYERS grab up their scripts, start paging through them._)
BILLY. I've got it! Page three-three. Saul's right! We skipped the whole bit about the diamond necklace.
AGGIE. How come I don't have that page?
GERRY. Oh, dear, maybe I miscounted when I was getting the Xeroxes made. Does everybody _else _have it? (_PLAYERS ad-lib assent._) Okay, then, let's back up and do the part we skipped.
AGGIE. How can I follow along without that page?
SAUL. Here, take _my_ script. I've got the lines down cold. (_A little testily._) _If _I ever get the chance to _say _them!
BILLY. Say, while we're stopped, I've got a question.
GERRY. (_Wearily._) _What?_
BILLY. It's about the play's title-isn't that a steal from something else? An old Agatha Christie movie, I think it was.
VIOLET. Oh, _I _don't think Phyllis Montague would _steal _a title, Billy.
SAUL. There's no way she _could! _No one can copyright a _title! _It's the law. There just aren't enough words to go around to name things.
-17-
BILLY. Even if that's true-what about the advertising for our show? Won't some people think this show _is _by Agatha Christie?
POLLY. (_Shrugs._) So much the better for our box office!
HENRY. And it _is_ a murder mystery, so no one gets hurt!
VIOLET. Doesn't sound like much of a murder mystery, if no one gets hurt . . . ?
SMITTY. _I _thought Sir Percival got bumped off by Doctor Forbes-?!
GERRY. (_Who has been trying to regain control of the group during the overlap-delivery of preceding eight speeches._) Hold it! All of you! Did we come here tonight to rehearse, or to discuss Originality Versus Plagiarism?
BILLY. Gerry's right. Let's get back to work. Sorry I interrupted.
POLLY. Which line do we go back to?
SMITTY. Yeah, where does the necklace come in, anyhow?
AGGIE. (_Moving Offstage, reading from script._) Oh, _I_ see what happened. Smitty, you came in too early.
SMITTY. I did? I thought I was supposed to enter when Violet says that line about the treacherous roads.
AGGIE. (_Laughs._) You're _almost _right-it's where she says the line about "lecherous toads!"
SMITTY. Oh, gee, I'm sorry. But it _sounds _about the same.
SAUL. Phyllis Montague fancies herself a poet.
POLLY. She _is _a poet. A rare talent-and a great writer!
SAUL. Would you say that if she had you playing _a mute?_
HENRY. Now, see here-!
GERRY. Stop it, all of you! Smitty, listen to me-this is important-you _mustn't _take your cue from the words alone. Pay attention to the _plot. _Then you'll _know _when you're supposed to enter, even if Violet says the line _wrong, _don't you see?
-18-
VIOLET. _I _didn't say the line wrong!
BILLY. You didn't say it at _all!_
VIOLET. Well, how _could _I when Smitty came in _early?!_
GERRY. All right, all right, that's enough! Do your arguing on your own time.
LOUISE. (_Off._) _Coffee's _ready!
AGGIE. (_Closes script._) Finally! I could _use _a cup! 
POLLY. But we've barely gotten started!
GERRY. Listen, maybe a break is a good idea. Let's all have a cup, then take this thing from the top and get it right!
BILLY. _Now _you're talking!
(_PLAYERS will emigrate toward sound of _LOUISE'S _call, and _GERRY _will come up on stage to join _AGGIE _as they exit._)
GERRY. Aggie-don't go yet. I want to talk to you. I'm getting very worried about our progress.
AGGIE. _What _progress?!
GERRY. (_Laughs ruefully._) I know what you mean. We've never been this far behind on a show.
AGGIE. It's not your fault, Gerry. We've never had the illustrious _author _in our hair before, either! If Phyllis didn't keep _rewriting _the damned show while the cast is trying to _learn _it-!
GERRY. She's _promised _not to change anything _else, _Aggie.
AGGIE. What do you want to bet she's going to show up here with seven new pages?!
GERRY. Oh, _don't, _Aggie! _They _haven't learned the _last _batch of rewrites!
-19-
AGGIE. Small wonder, the way, Polly keeps inviting Phyllis to dinner, and getting her part fattened! It's almost as big as _she is, _now!
GERRY. Aggie, don't _you_ start with the fat-jokes, please! I'm having enough trouble with _Saul!_
AGGIE. If Polly had her way, this play would be a one-woman _monologue!_
GERRY. Well, at least Phyllis is letting us do her play _free!_
AGGIE. Naturally! Nobody would pay _money _to do it!
GERRY. Be fair, Aggie-it's not _that _bad.
AGGIE. Oh-I suppose not. But if Polly keeps padding her part-!
GERRY. She won't. I'll have to put my foot down. Three days until dress rehearsal-we'll be lucky if we learn the lines we've _got!_
AGGIE. Oh, I don't know about that-some of the _mistakes _tonight are better than the _original _lines! If you'd just let the cast alone, this show could be a riot!
GERRY. Aggie, "Murder Most Foul" is _not _a _comedy! _Phyllis Montague would _scream _if the audience started _laughing at _it! She'd pass right out on the floor!
AGGIE. Well, then, you'd better have the smelling-salts handy for opening night.
GERRY. Oh, Aggie-!
(_But before they can continue, PLAYERS start returning to the stage, sipping coffee, so they let it drop._)
GERRY. (_Starts off._) Is there anything left in the pot? (_Will exit during :_)
SAUL. (_Who has just taken a sip, makes a terrible face._) Not if you're lucky!
LOUISE. (Off.) I _heard _that, Saul Watson!
-20-
SAUL. (_Amiably._) Then let it be a lesson to you! (_Offstage, we hear _LOUISE _laugh._)
POLLY. (_Sitting in center of sofa._) I hope we get this act done tonight. Three days till dress rehearsal and we haven't even done a full run-through!
BILLY. Thank your friend _Phyllis _for _that!_
HENRY. You mustn't blame Phyllis, Billy-she's simply a perfectionist.
SMITTY. If she wasn't satisfied with the script, why did she submit it?
SAUL. Because if we'd picked some other show, she'd have had to wait till next _year_ to get it done !
VIOLET. Why couldn't we do it as our _next _show?
BILLY. We've got our audiences pre-conditioned.
SAUL. "Brainwashed" is more like it!
POLLY. That's putting it rather strongly, Saul.
SAUL. It's the unvarnished truth. We never vary, season after season. We do a mystery, a comedy, a drama, and a musical, in that order, without fail.
VIOLET. Yes, but why?
HENRY. We started the theatre that way, and it just got to be a habit. For us _and _our patrons.
VIOLET. But what would be the harm if we mixed it up?
SAUL. It would confuse people. The comedy fans would come to the drama and laugh at all the tragic moments-and the musical fans would start beating time to the comedy-!
BILLY. Or sob during the mystery!
AGGIE. They may _still _do _that!_
GERRY. (_Re-enters with cup of coffee._) Aggie! Whose side are you on, anyway?!
AGGIE. On the side of _sanity_-which doesn't do me much good around _here_! (_Exits toward coffee._)
-21-
SAUL. (_Drains his cup._) Well, _I'm _all set. Anybody _else _ready to give it a go?
POLLY. Oh, relax, Saul. We're all _much _too tense, tonight. Why do we keep _snapping at _each other the way we do? This near the opening, we're usually kidding around and having a _marvelous time!_
BILLY. If you want _my_ opinion, we're running scared.
SMITTY. Scared of _what_?
SAUL. In our own way, Smitty, we're just as perfection-oriented as our author. We want the show to be a smash, not a smash-up.
HENRY. Amen.
(AGGIE _re-enters with empty tray, starts collecting cups._)
POLLY. We'll get it. Somehow, no matter how awful a show may look in rehearsal, we always manage to bring it off.
GERRY. That's with a _printed _script, Polly. This typewritten stuff is okay, don't get me wrong-it's all the _revisions _that are killing us!
POLLY. But Phyllis gave her solemn word-
SAUL. It's the only kind of word she knows! I'll bet she's never giggled in her life!
VIOLET.  And she promised the same thing _last _week, Polly, then showed up on Monday with three new scenes!
SAUL. I wish she wouldn't keep changing the identity of the murderer! I don't know whether to radiate menace or charm the pants off everyone!
GERRY. Well, you won't do _either _just _standing _there! Come on, everybody, positions! (AGGIE _will exit with the last of their cups, during:_) Let's see if we can't go through to the curtain without stopping. (_Will descend from stage and move toward her seat._)
-22-
SMITTY. (_Starts 0ffstage._) We'd better! I've got to get home and study for a biology exam!
BILLY. Wait, Smitty! . . . Gerry-are we taking it from the top, or where?
GERRY. Why don't we go back to Violet's line, when Smitty made her entrance too early, and do the page we left out?
(_PLAYERS ad-lib assent, and get into their positions._)
VIOLET.  I can't remember what my line _is!_
SAUL. Aggie, throw her a cue!
AGGIE. (Off.) Just let me find the place . . . (_They wait a moment; then:_) Okay, I found it. Violet, I'll feed you Billy's line, then you start.
VIOLET. Okay.
AGGIE. (Off.) "Ah, but Lady Margaret, he might have had motor trouble."
VIOLET. (_In character._) "Yes, indeed. I do hope _he _hasn't had an-" Wait, I'll get it.
POLLY. I certainly _hope so_!
GERRY. Quiet, Polly. Go on, Violet.
VIOLET. ". . . I do hope he hasn't had an _accident! _These roads can be treacherous at night."
SMITTY. (Off.) Is that where I-?
GERRY. No, no! That was "treacherous"! Wait for "lecherous"!
SMITTY. (_0ff ._) Oh, yeah. Sorry.
GERRY. (_After a silence._) Well? Who _does _have the next line?
AGGIE. (_Off._) It's Polly's.
POLLY. (_Straightens up._) Oh, my! Let me see-
AGGIE. (_Off._) It's-
POLLY. No, don't tell me! I'll get it!
VIOLET. (_Happy to return _POLLY'S _earlier comment._) I certainly _hope _so!
-23-
GERRY. Oh, for the love of-!
POLLY. I've got it, I've got it! Violet, would you-?
VIOLET. (_Interrupts wearily with the cue-line:_) ". . . roads can be treacherous at night!"
POLLY. "Don't say such a thing! It would make one think that perhaps there was some truth, after all, in that story about the curse!"
HENRY. "Nonsense, my dear. There's no such thing as a curse."
BILLY. "And yet-everyone who has ever owned the Delhi Diamond-" (_Stops._) Gerry-does it _have _to be called that?! It sounds like it comes from a delicatessen!
POLLY. That's because you're not sounding the "h," Billy. "Dell-hee !"-not "Delly" I
SAUL. Polly, that "h" is silent! It _is _pronounced "Delly" 
SMITTY. (_Enters._) Can't we _please _go on? I've got to study for that exam!
GERRY. No, wait, Smitty-Billy's got a point. It _does _sound like it belongs alongside the liverwurst-it looks all right when you read it in the script, but it sounds just plain silly!
SAUL. Okay, so call it the _"Calcutta _Diamond"!
POLLY. You can't _do _that! Phyllis Montague told me particularly that she chose that name for its lovely alliteration-"Delhi Diamond"-
SAUL. Okay, so we'll alliterate-we'll call it the "Calcutta Carbuncle"!
VIOLET. _Carbuncle?_
SAUL. Yeah. It's a big stone like a ruby-a garnet-cut whatchacallit-a cabochon!
VIOLET. Well, it _sounds _like a big _zit!_
SAUL. So do you!
GERRY. Saul! Stop it! There _must _be another gem we can use
-24-
POLLY. You shouldn't tamper with Phyllis's dialogue -she won't like it.
GERRY. She'll like it a lot _less _if her "Delhi Diamond" gets a _laugh!_
HENRY. Gerry's right, dear. We _should _have a different name for it.
POLLY. (_Half convinced._) Well-
BILLY. Hey, _I've _got it! Let's call it the "Ranchipur Ruby"!
SAUL. Hey, _I like _that! It's got class!
POLLY. But whatever will we tell Phyllis?!
SMITTY. Tell her she _rewrote _it that way ! She's done so many revisions, she'll probably believe it! (_Exits._)
GERRY. Well, let's hope so! Meanwhile - _children_ can we return to the play?!
BILLY. Okay, okay. Where was I-?
AGGIE. (Off.) Hey, Gerry, should I write in that change, or not?
GERRY. You may as well-but do it in pencil, just in case.
AGGIE. (Off.) Gotcha. (_Beat._) How do you spell "Ranchipur"?
GERRY. (_At wit's end._) _Fake _it! Nobody has to _read _it but _you_! (_To _BILLY.) Go ahead with your line-it's the one right after Lord Dudley scoffs at the curse.
BILLY. Oh, yeah . . . "And yet-everyone who has ever owned the Ranchipur Ruby has always met with a dreadful demise!"
POLLY. There! You see? I _knew _there was a reason for Phyllis's words. It's double-alliteration: "Delhi Diamond" and "dreadful demise"!
SAUL. Oh, who _gives _a damn?!
HENRY. See here, you can't talk to my wife like that!
GERRY. Henry, for once I agree with Saul! Who _gives _a damn! Billy, go on!
BILLY. Right! . . . "And yet-everyone who has ever owned the Ranchipur Ruby has always met with a _rotten requiem!"_
-25-
(_ALL laugh except _POLLY _and _HENRY.)
SAUL. Aw, c'mon, Billy! You sound like an elocution teacher!
BILLY. (_Shrugs._) So does Phyllis Montague!
POLLY. Now,, really- !.
VIOLET. It double-alliterates, doesn't it?
GERRY. Billy-don't. Leave the line's ending- as written. Please?
BILLY. Oh, all right. "-has always met with a dreadful demise!"
VIOLET. (_Beat._) Oh! _My_ line! (_Into character._) "But Percival doesn't own the diamond-" Oops, wait! "-the _ruby _anymore-not since he sold. it to Lord Dudley for Lady Margaret's collection."'
SAUL. "Nevertheless-Percival _did _own it-and that might be enough."
BILLY. "See here, Doctor Forbes-you are a man of science-surely _you_ don't believe in curses?"
SAUL. "I only know there are strange things in the history of India-things which, defy rational explanation."
HENRY. "Nonsense. Sheer Poppycock. Superstitious drivel!"
SAUL. "Quite possibly, Lord Dudley-and yet-"
POLLY. "And yet-?"
SAUL. _"Where _is Sir Percival?"
VIOLET. "Frankly, I'm _glad _he's not here"
POLLY. "Why, Diana, what a thing to say!"
VIOLET. "I mean it_. _Sir Percival is no gentleman."
HENRY. "Here, now, what are you saying?" 
VIOLET. "When he looks at me-I feel as though his hands were moving all over my body."
-26-
POLLY. "But-he is a knight of the realm!"
VIOLET. "He is a disgusting toad. And such toads can be lecherous at night!"
(SMITTY _enters._)
SMITTY. "Begging your pardon, milord, but should we delay dinner any longer?"
(_PHONE RINGS._)
GERRY. (_Comes to her feet._) _Louise! _What are you _doing?!_
LOUISE. (_Off._) Isn't that where the phone rings? . . . Oh, wait! I turned two pages at once! Sorry about that!
POLLY. "Sorry," she says! If she does that during the performance-!
GERRY. She won't, Polly, she won't! Louise, you've got to be more careful !
LOUISE. (_Off._) Look on the bright side. Now we know the phone-bell works.
POLLY. That woman! I could-!
SAUL. No you couldn't. Louise has a black belt in karate.
POLLY. And how do you know _I _haven't?!
SAUL. They only go up to size forty-four!
GERRY. (_Apprehensively._) Saul-?
(_But it is too late; _POLLY _comes to her feet so fast that the chair falls over backwards, and storms Offstage with _HENRY _meekly in her wake, on:_)
POLLY. That does it! I'm through!
HENRY. Now, honey, you mustn't be hasty about this-! (_They are gone; remaining PLAYERS look accusingly at SAUL._)
-27-
SAUL. (_Much abashed._) I was only _kidding . . ._
LOUISE. (_Wanders. Onstage._) What was that crash? (_Sees fallen chair._) Oh.
SAUL. I better go apologize.. (_Hurries out after duo._)
VIOLET. (_Dispirited._) What do we do now?
AGGIE. (_Comes Onstage, script in hand._) You can't work _around _her-she's got herself in damn near every scene.
BILLY. (_Righting chair and straightening "sofa."_) Not the love scene in Act Two. Maybe we could do that one.
VIOLET. Can't we wait till we have a real sofa? That metal's awfully hard to cuddle on.
GERRY. Aggie, when _do _we get the sofa?
AGGIE. We should've had it two days ago.
GERRY. Could you call and find out?
AGGIE. I could try. (_Exits._)
LOUISE. You want a look at that corridor wall, Gerry?
GERRY. (_Will get onto stage._) Yes, I'd better. I'm worried about those braces.
LOUISE. You and me both. I've got six two-by-fours on it already, and the thing still flaps like a sail ! (_They will move Offstage during:_)
SMITTY. Well, I guess I'll go hit the old biology book!
BILLY. You've got it _here?_
SMITTY. Why not? All the time I spend waiting to make my entrance, I could study for _three _exams! (_Exits._)
BILLY. Well, Violet, whattaya say-?
VIOLET. Oh-all right. (_Gets up from "armchair," sits on "sofa."_) Ready when you are.
BILLY. (_Moves to point just inside right doorway._) Okay. On your mark-get set- (_Into character._) "Oh! Diana. I was seeking Lady Margaret."
VIOLET. "Lady Margaret is cutting roses in the garden, Stephen." (_Looks down demurely, folds her hands in her lap._) "She-may not return for some time."
-28-
BILLY. "I see." (_Moves closer._) "Would you mind if I waited for her . . . here?"
VIOLET. "Naturally not."
BILLY. "Might I . . . sit?"
VIOLET. "If you are-so inclined."
BILLY. (_Sits beside her._) "Diana-"
VIOLET. (_Ryes still downcast, turns head away._) "Yes, Stephen-?"
BILLY. "Would you take offense if I were to-to-?"
VIOLET. "Stephen, what are you trying to say?"
BILLY. "Oh, dash it all, Diana, must we play at words?! You _know _the message that longs to cry out from within my heart'!"
VIOLET. (_Raises her eyes, looks at him._) "Is it possible-do I dare for a moment imagine-that the message in your heart is the selfsame message that cries out from within my own-?"
BILLY. "Diana-do you mean-do I dare to dream-?" (_Takes her hands._)
VIOLET. "Have a care, sir-have a care-you know that I am betrothed to another man!"
BILLY. "And yet-you do not draw away . . . ?"
VIOLET. "Oh, Stephen-can you not reason out _why?!"_
BILLY. "I-I am almost afraid to!"
VIOLET. "Then _cease _your noble trepidations, Stephen Sellers. For-though I am a high-born lady-I am also a woman !"
BILLY. "Oh, Diana!" (_Kisses her lightly on the lips._) 
VIOLET. "Oh, Stephen!" (Lays _her head against his shoulder._) If Doctor Forbes should come upon us-!" 
BILLY. _"Hang _your illustrious fiancé! He shall not have you!" (_Kisses her again, a bit more firmly._) "Oh, Diana-!"
-29-

VIOLET. Oh-Billy!
BILLY. Oh-Violet! (_And they go into _a real _clinch, clutching and caressing and swaying, the metal chairs rattling until:_)
LOUISE. (_Enters._) What's all that clattering-?! (_They spring apart and come to their feet._) Ha! No _wonder _you want a real sofa!
VIOLET. Now, Louise-!
LOUISE. I didn't see a thing. Not a thing. (_Gives _a _happy cackle of amusement and exits._)
VIOLET. Billy-do you think she suspects?!
BILLY. How could she? I didn't suspect, _myself, _till just a moment ago!
VIOLET. Oh, darling, neither did I! (_They almost embrace, but break decorously apart and try to look innocent as they hear:_)
PHYLLIS. (_Off._) Yoo-hoo-?' Anybody _here-?!_
VIOLET. Billy! That sounds like Miss Montague! 
BILLY. Tonight? But she promised not to come back till dress rehearsal!
(_OTHERS reappear Onstage via various routes, all wearing the same apprehensive look as our duo._)
GERRY. Did _you_ all hear what _I _heard-?
POLLY. It sounded like _Phyllis!_
SAUL. Probably with five new pages of dialogue for _you_!
POLLY. (_With patient forbearance._) Saul-I just accepted _one _apology from you-do you want to have to make_ another?!_
SAUL. (_Sincerely._) Sorry, Polly. (_This time we can definitely pinpoint the source of the voice as emanating from the rear of the theatre:_)
-30-
PHYLLIS. Yoo-hoo! How _are _you all?!
(_ALL turn and peer out into theatre, watching the progress of _PHYLLIS MONTAGUE-a _maiden lady of indeterminate age, probably anywhere between forty-two and fifty-seven-and especially noting the sheaf of papers she carries, as she hurries happily down the aisle toward the stage._)
GERRY. Why-Phyllis-we weren't expecting you-at least, not tonight-!
PHYLLIS. Oh, I _know _I'm being _a naughty _girl, Geraldine, but I have so many new and good things to share with you all that I simply _couldn't _wait until the dress rehearsal!
SAUL. (_Wide-eyed, and absolutely frank:_) Well, _that's _a mercy!
(PHYLLIS _has gotten up Onstage, now, and is moving along the row of people there, handing each an identical sheaf of stapled-together pages, during:_)
GERRY. Phyllis! _More _changes? We _open _in four nights!
PHYLLIS. That's why I decided not to wait until dress rehearsal to stop by. This would be much-too-much to have to learn in one night!
HENRY. What makes you think we can do it in _three?_
PHYLLIS. Oh, don't be a tease, Henry. It's really all very simple. I've simply added just _one _extra character and cut the love-scene.
BILLY & VIOLET. (_In woeful unison._) "_Cut _the _love_-scene"?!
PHYLLIS. Perhaps I'm putting it too strongly-it's not precisely cut-just cut out of Act Two and moved back to Act One.
-31-
BILLY. Oh, well, that's not so bad.
PHYLLIS. Except it's no longer between Diana and Stephen.
VIOLET. Then-between who else?
AGGIE. Yeah, the Lord and Lady are already married-
SMITTY. You _can't _mean the Doctor and the _Maid-_can you?
PHYLLIS. Oh, dear, perhaps I didn't make it clear. _Diana _still plays the scene-but now it's with Sir Percival!
GERRY. What? But Phyllis-
LOUISE. How can you do such a thing?
PHYLLIS. Oh, well, I got to thinking that perhaps a knight of the realm was a better catch for Diana than a mere rich commoner like Stephen, so-
LOUISE. Phyllis, I didn't say _why-I _said _how _can you do it? We don't _have _a Sir Percival in the play!
GERRY. Exactly ! Everybody _refers _to him, all the time, but he never actually _appears!_
SAUL. Besides, it's kind of rough on _Diana _if you make that switch-considering that I _bump off _Percival before I show up at the house!
PHYLLIS. You _do?_
POLLY. Don't you even remember your own _plot, _Phyllis?
PHYLLIS. Yes, but I don't recall a _murder . . _show me where it says so.
BILLY. We never actually _see _it done. But once we find that Percival has vanished, and then Rex has the famous gemstone Percival was bringing to the party, we figure out who _killed _him, see?
PHYLLIS. (_Pondering deeply._) Murder. I never thought of it as a murder. I just thought that, well, Rex had picked Percival's pocket, and perhaps drained all the petrol from the tank of his car to keep him from the party. After all-murder is so-so-
-32-
GERRY. _Popular _with our _patrons!_
POLLY. And we're already _advertising _it as a murder mystery!
AGGIE. And we _do open _in _four nights, _Phyllis, for Pete's _sake! _It's a bit late to audition Percivals!
PHYLLIS. Oh, but I've written you all the loveliest new lines . . . ! (_Looks ready to weep._) Won't you-won't you at least have _a look _at them-?
(_There is a pause, and an exchange of glances among the group, and then-since none of them is truly heartless-they all shrug and mumble some sort of assent, and start looking-just a bit warily-at the new pages._)
VIOLET. (_Gasps._) I'm _pregnant_! (_OTHERS react, of course._)
BILLY. You're _what?!_
VIOLET. I mean _Diana is_! (_OTHERS evince great relief; she continues:_) But who's the father?
PHYLLIS. That's on the third sheet. (_ALL flip pages like mad; then:_)
AGGIE. Lord Dudley!
POLLY. (_Appalled._) Henry!
HENRY. (_Patiently._) Polly, don't be an idiot.
POLLY. Oh. Yes. But-it _was _a bit of a shock.
BILLY. This is crazy! Phyllis, how can Dudley be the father, when he and Diana have only just met?! 
PHYLLIS. Oh, that's on the fifth sheet. (_ALL flip pages again._)
GERRY. _Amnesia?!_
PHYLLIS. Yes, because that explains why he doesn't remember their meeting.
SMITTY. But if she's carrying his child, _Diana _must remember something!
PHYLLIS. No, that's explained on page seven. (_Again ALL flip like crazy._) You see, it was a very dark night, and-
-33-
GERRY. (_Closes up her sheaf, lets hand holding sheaf drop._) Phyllis, this is totally _impossible! _The entire _thrust _of the plot is altered! Everybody has a brand-new motivation for what they do!
PHYLLIS. Well, surely, with a little work-
LOUISE. In the next four _days?!_
SAUL. We couldn't do it in four _months!_
PHYLLIS. But-I've worked so hard-!
GERRY. And we _haven't?! _Phyllis, there's _no _way we can make these changes at this late date!
PHYLLIS. But they're such _little _changes!
BILLY. Little?! What about the ending? If Stephen is going to marry Diana, won't her pregnancy kind of put a _crimp _in the festivities?
PHYLLIS. Well, I'm working on that.
GERRY. _More _changes?! Phyllis Montague, do you have any notion how _hard _it is to do a play-even a play that _doesn't _change direction every three days?! This script should have been finalized three _weeks _ago!
POLLY. (_Who has been reading the new sheets._) What's this?! Lady Margaret goes into _shock _at the news of Diana's pregnancy and loses the power of _speech?!_
SAUL. (_Brightens._) Really? Say, maybe this version's not so bad _after _all!
GERRY. (_Warningly._) Saul . . . !
SMITTY. And what about my _mother?_
GERRY. (_Distracted._) What _about _your mother?
SMITTY. Well, when I first tried out for the part, my mother insisted on looking over the script because she didn't want me in a play full of sex! If Diana's pregnant, I'll have to quit the show.
PHYLLIS. But she's only _two months _pregnant-I mean, it's not going to _show-?!_
SMITTY. Mother thinks ahead.
-34-
PHYLLIS. (_A little genteel blackmail._) Well, of course, if you'd _all _rather not _do _my little play--
GERRY. (_Having none of it._) Now, hold it _right _there, Phyllis! We all appreciate the chance to do a play for which we do not have to pay royalties-in fact, doing your show would put the theatre budget in the black for the first time in six months! However -when the play-reading committee agreed to do this play of yours, it was on the basis of the _original _script! Now, _that _play we promised to do, and we will-but all this _new_ stuff has nothing to _do _with that agreement-!
PHYLLIS. (_Trying to hide her dismay._) You're telling me that you now feel free to _reject _my play-?
GERRY. Not the play _as first _submitted, Phyllis-and I'll even allow you _all _the alterations you've _already _made-but this _last _batch is just too much!
PHYLLIS. (_One last stand._) Do you have the authority to speak for the entire committee?
GERRY. No. But when I tell them it's either the _first _version or _no _version, I'll have their _unanimous _backing!
PHYLLIS. (_Trying to save face._) Well, of course, if you really feel _strongly _about this matter, dear Geraldine- (_ALL simply stare at her; she wilts, and seeks an ally._) Polly! How do _you_ feel about it-7
POLLY. Well-I-it _is_ rather close to opening night, Phyllis, and-and-of course, _perhaps-_
SAUL. (_Quietly._) Remember-she cut _all _your speeches-
POLLY. (_Remembers._) I'm with Gerry! (_Hands sheaf back to _PHYLLIS; _OTHERS all immediately do the same, until she holds an untidy stack, during :_)
VIOLET. Me, too_!_
BILLY. You bet!
SMITTY. Absolutely!
-35-
SAUL. Right on!
HENRY. I agree!
LOUISE. Thanks, anyway!
AGGIE. Nice try!
GERRY. Sorry, Phyllis!
PHYLLIS. (_Very annoyed and somewhat angry._) All right. All right. Go ahead and _do _the original version. But if the show's _reviews _turn out to be a box-office disaster-well-!
SAUL. We'll all remember who _wrote _the original.
PHYLLIS. Oh! _Oh! _OH! (_Slams her stack under one arm and storms off into the wings; ALL pause, listening, till we hear DOOR SLAM._)
GERRY. Do you think-maybe-we were a little rough on her-?
POLLY. She _did _take it rather hard . . .
HENRY. She said once at dinner that-she looks upon this play as her _child-_
POLLY. It's the only offspring she'll ever have-
HENRY. And when she tried to make that child a little prettier--
GERRY. Oh, dear! I wish you hadn't put it like that!
SAUL. Gerry, don't be a sap! Phyllis wasn't making her child _prettier-she _was giving it an extra _head!_
GERRY. (_Laughs, her good sense restored._) You're right. Let's leave the kid alone and start learning to love it _as is!_
BILLY. _Now _you're talking!
AGGIE. Come on, everyone-you _came _here to rehearse-so let's _rehearse!_
LOUISE. (_Starts Offstage._) I'll give you all to the count of three-and if I don't hear some snappy dialogue, I'm picking up that _hammer again!_
AGGIE. (_Moving after _Louisa) And _I'll _hold the _nails!_
GERRY. (_Starts Offstage as they exit._) _I'm _grabbing another cup of coffee-_you_ people pick up your long faces and get into character! (_Exits._)
-36-
BILLY. (_Calls after her._) Shall we take it from the top?
GERRY. (_Off._) _Not _if you want to finish the act before _dawn! _Pick it up from Saul's line about the telegraph office.
SAUL. Right! (_Gets into character as PLAYERS get into places, and:_) "Well-as a matter of fact-I don't have it. The message was phoned from the telegraph office."
BILLY. "Doris-have there been any telephone messages this evening?"
SAUL. "See here, you insolent young pup! Are you doubting my word? !"
POLLY. "Of course he isn't, Rex! Stephen, you should apologize to Doctor Forbes!"
BILLY. "Oh, I shall. As soon as Doris answers my question."
SMITTY. "No, sir."
POLLY. "What, are you quite sure?"
SMITTY. "The telephone has been out of order since this _afternoon, _mum."
BILLY. "Aha! And what do you say to _that, _Doctor Forbes?"
(_The PHONE rings._)
SAUL. "Does _that _answer your question?"
POLLY. "Stephen, I believe you owe Doctor Forbes an apology."
(_PHONE RINGS again._)
HENRY. "You had best answer that, Doris, before we owe the _caller _an apology, too!"
SMITTY. (_Moving to phone._) "Yes, sir!" (_Answers._) "Hello-? . . . Who? . . . Why, yes, he is. Just a moment." (_Extends phone to _HENRY.) "It's for you, sir."
-37-
HENRY. (_As he takes phone._) "Who is it, Doris?" 
SMITTY. "Sir Percival."
SAUL. (_Aghast._) "It _can't _be-! . . . I mean-" 
BILLY. (_Calmly._) "Yes, Doctor? Exactly what _do _you mean?"
SAUL. "Why-I-I-"
(GERRY, _sipping coffee, appears in Upstage doorway, watching group, and _AGGIE _appears similarly outside Upstage window, during :_)
HENRY. (_On phone._) "Hello? . . . What? . . . Ah! Yes, I see . . . Yes, thank you! Thank you very much!" (_Hangs up._)
POLLY. "Why-Dudley-you look so strange! What did Percival say?"
(HENRY _opens his mouth to reply, but before he can:_) 
GERRY. Excuse me, just a moment-(_PLAYERS pause and all look toward her._)
VIOLET. Did we do something wrong?
GERRY. No, of course not. But I wanted to see what you were all _doing _when the phone rang. Could we take it back a few lines-?
AGGIE. It's a long way to the end of the act, Gerry. Do you think-?
GERRY. This will only take a moment, Aggie. Just back up to Smitty's line about the phone, okay-?
(_PLAYERS ad-lib assent, shift into positions, and:_)
SMITTY. "The telephone has been out of order since this _afternoon, _mum_."_
-38-
BILLY. "Aha! And what do you say to _that, _Doctor Forbes?"
(_And from the phone comes the sound of a musical AUTO-HORN [C-E-low G-E]; _ALL _react._)
ALL. _Louise!_
LOUISE. (_Off._) Sorry! I forgot to wind the tape back! Hang on-now I've got it!
(_PLAYERS get into position, and:_)
BILLY. "Aha! And what do you say to _that, _Doctor Forbes?'
(_And from the phone comes the sound of a GUNSHOT._)
LOUISE. (_Off._) Oops! Wrong place!
AGGIE. (_Shakes her head._) And only four more days till opening night!
(_PLAYERS all sag, and we hear :_)
LOUISE. (_Off._) _I'll _get it! (_Sound of AUTO-HORN._) Oops! (_Sound of GUNSHOT._) Sorry! (_Sound of SCREECH OF TIRES._) Damn it all to hell!
(_And as we hear-in quick succession-the sounds of, in order, AUTO-HORN, THUNDERING FOOTSTEPS, SCREECH OF TIRES, GUNSHOT-SCREAM -GUNSHOT -SCREAM-GUNSHOT-SCREAM-during which the dispirited GROUP all sag lower and lower and lower_.)
(_THE CURTAIN FALLS_)
!ACT II 
-39-
(_The set as we last saw it, except that the Upstage corridor wall is now in place, and there are a real sofa and a real armchair in place of the folding chairs in Act One. [NOTE: If you desire a more radical transformation, you might also have lacked, in Act One, the window-drapes, the tray of liquor bottles and glasses on the sideboard, and the books-or some of them-on the bookshelves; these items will be in place, now, of course, in this act.] Just before curtain-rise, have the house lights dim _halfway _and the curtain closed until counter indicated. When lights have dimmed, we hear from the rear of house:_)
GERRY. Louise? Why isn't the curtain open? (GERRY _will come down aisle to her place, during :_)
LOUISE. (Off.) There's a draft up here. The curtain keeps some of it out!
GERRY. That's because someone left the front door open. I closed it.
(_Curtain starts to open._)
LOUISE. (Off.) Why are theatres always drafty backstage?!
AGGIE. (_Off._) They're designed that way on purpose. The breeze comes in handy if the play smells!
(_GERRY sits in front row as curtain comes fully open._)
GERRY. I don't suppose you have _a particular _play in mind, Aggie--?
-40-
AGGIE. (_Off. Laughs._) Don't say I didn't warn you!
(GERRY _laughs, and then _BILLY _steps Onstage in costume [NOTE: Costumes for the play-within-the-play are a bit old-fashioned-Edwardian clothing for the men, evening gowns for _VIOLET _and _POLLY, _and a black dress with short white apron _and _cap for SMITTY]_)
BILLY. Gerry, do we have to wear makeup tonight?
GERRY. Well, I don't care so much about the men-but I did want to see how the women look-especially their hairdos.
BILLY. (_Starting off._) I think they're using wigs. GERRY. I've _seen _the wigs-I want to see how they look _wearing them._
BILLY. I'll tell 'em. (_As he exits, he passes _AGGIE _just coming Onstage._)
AGGIE. (_Flips a thumb Upstage._) How do you like the wall?
GERRY. Well-it looks okay on _this _side-but how much space is there to move behind it?
AGGIE. If everyone's careful, they'll have about two inches clearance on either side- (_Lowers her voice, leans forward to add confidentially:_) Except for _Polly, _. of course!
GERRY. How's she going to get from the garden to the prop table for the roses she brings onstage?
AGGIE. She doesn't have to. I'm going to keep the roses on _that _side of the stage. I told her it was to simplify things for her-but I didn't tell her what I simplifying.
GERRY. That's good thinking. We've got to keep her in a happy mood. She nearly walked out _again, _last night, thanks to Saul Watson!
AGGIE. (_Chuckles at the memory._) You gotta admit -he was pretty funny!
-41-
GERRY. Yes, but his sense of humor cost us a half-hour! At least, I got him to _swear _he'll say that Lord Dudley is off to _"have a word _with Lady Margaret"-not _"chew the fat" _with her!
AGGIE. Yeah, but even if he behaves himself in rehearsal, how do we know what he's gonna do when the show's in performance?
GERRY. I don't want to think about it. I'm already having nightmares!
AGGIE. I'm surprised you can sleep at all. Tomorrow night, the whole thing will be out of your hands. All you can do _then _is stand in the wings and pray . . . there's not enough _room _to _kneel!_
GERRY. Maybe I'll just spend opening night in some cozy bar. In another town.
(_LOUISE enters, carrying a sparkling necklace._)
LOUISE. Hey, how do you like _this _thing, Gerry? Looks _real, _doesn't it?!
GERRY. It certainly does. It was nice of Phyllis to lend it to us for the show. Costume jewelry that good is awfully expensive.
AGGIE. Have you figured out yet what to do about the central stone? We still haven't told Phyllis we've nixed her "Delhi Diamond"-how are we going to pass this thing off as a ruby?
GERRY. As a matter of fact, _Billy _came up with the solution to that: From now on, it's known as the "White Ruby of Ranchipur"!
LOUISE. (_Moving with necklace toward wall safe._) _Is _there such a thing as a white ruby?
GERRY. (_Wearily._) There is, _now_! (LOUISE _and _AGGIE _laugh; _LOUISE _opens door of safe._) And _please _keep that in a safe place between performances, Louise. We wouldn't want it to get misplaced, or stolen!
LOUISE. Don't worry. I figure this necklace is our ace in the hole-Phyllis will preoccupy herself worrying about _it _instead of the _play!_
-42-
AGGIE. There's something to _that, _all right.
GERRY. (_As _LOUISE _places necklace inside safe._) You know, I'd feel a lot easier if that safe had a back to it. A person could tiptoe up in back of the flat and pick the necklace right up.
LOUISE. I could nail one on-but I'd have to take the safe down, first-and that would mean repainting the flat.
GERRY. Why would you have to take it down?
LOUISE. Because if I hammer on the back, and the front is where it is now, the whole thing'11 tear loose from the flat and fall on the stage.
AGGIE. Tell you what-I'm not doing much except prompting, once this curtain's up. Why don't I just hang onto the thing, and then _hand _it to Saul when he reaches into the safe?
GERRY. Would you _mind, _Aggie? It'd set my mind at rest.
AGGIE. No trouble at all.
LOUISE. (_Will retrieve necklace and re-close safe, on:_) Well, you'd better practice it, then-tonight's your only chance before the opening.
AGGIE. (_Takes necklace._) Easy as pie. But the practice can't hurt.
LOUISE. (_To _GERRY.) You ready for the mob, yet?
GERRY. I guess so-if they're all in costume. 
LOUISE. Well, if they're not, it's their tough luck. (_Calls._) Hey! Everybody onstage!
(_We hear ad-libs akin to "Okay!", "Coming!" and such, from the PLAYERS, and then they come on, all in costume-except that _VIOLET _is carrying her costume-wig._)
GERRY. Line up along the front of the stage, will you? I want to see how you all look. The costumes _seem _to fit all right . . .
-43-
(_They line up while she's speaking [NOTE: This will also be the curtain-call lineup, and goes thusly, starting at Stage Left: _SAUL, VIOLET, HENRY, POLLY, BILLY, SMITTY.] )
POLLY. I think mine's just a little bit too small for me . . .
(_Then, as if expecting the worst after this lovely straight-line, PLAYERS all turn their heads to look at SAUL._)
SAUL. (_Since their stares are as good as any commentary from him._) _I didn't say a word!_
POLLY. And you'd better not!
GERRY. (_Annoyed._) Polly, be fair! It's one thing if he _picks _on you-but if you're going to blow up every time you think he _might _say something-!
POLLY. (_Abashed._) Yes. You're right. I'm sorry, Saul. Just-rehearsal jitters, I guess.
SAUL. No problem.
GERRY. Good. Now-turn around, all of you, slowly, so I can see what you look like in back . . . (_They do so, stopping once they're faced Upstage._) Mmm-yes -yes-yes, you all look fine . . . oh, wait a minute! Violet, why aren't _you_ wearing a bustle like Polly?
POLLY. (_Turns to face _GERRY.) I'm not _wearing _a bustle!
GERRY. Oh! Oh, dear, I'm sorry!
POLLY. (_Unexpectedly, laughs._) _You're _sorry !
(_OTHERS all laugh, then, and an atmosphere of good humor floods the stage; remaining PLAYERS now face front again._)
-44-
GERRY. Violet-why aren't you wearing that wig?
VIOLET. It's too big. Let me show you- (_Slips it on, and we see that it sits low on her brow, so that we can barely see her eyes._) See? I -look like a British sheepdog!
GERRY. Can't you pad it, or take a tuck in it, or something?
VIOLET. I'll think of something. I didn't have time, just now.
GERRY. Okay. Well, you're going to all _look _just _fine! _. . . Now suppose we see how well you can _act! _
AGGIE. Positions for Act One-?
GERRY. I guess we may as well start, yes.
(_PLAYERS start getting into position._)
LOUISE. (_Starting _off.) You want to do it with the curtain?
GERRY. Yes, I do. I want _everything _just as if this were the _performance!_
PHYLLIS. (_Off._) Yoo-hoo-!
(ALL _react._)
AGGIE. Gerry, I think you just got your wish. 
LOUISE. In spades! (LOUISE and AGGIE _exit as _PHYLLIS _enters, opposite._)
PHYLLIS. Oh, Geraldine, I have the most dreadful news. We're going to have to change the name of my play!
GERRY. What? We can't, Phyllis! The programs are all printed, and the publicity's been mailed out
PHYLLIS. But we must! I've just discovered that there is a _movie _with the _same _title-"Murder Most Foul"!
POLLY. Phyllis, no one in the audience is likely to be confused. They can _see _this isn't a _movie!_
-45-
SAUL. Right! In a movie, no one forgets their lines. (_PLAYERS give him a woebegone look._)
SMITTY. Don't _say _things like that, Saul! I'm having enough trouble already!
PHYLLIS. Oh, I _do _hope you are _joking, _Marla!
BILLY. _Who? . . . _Oh! I almost forgot your _real _name, Smitty.
SMITTY. No one ever uses it-except my mother.
SAUL. And Phyllis.
PHYLLIS. Oh, but I think nicknames are so vulgar, Saul. Don't you?
SAUL. I'm the wrong guy to ask, Phyl.
GERRY. (_Quickly, before _PHYLLIS _can quite become angry._) _Phyllis-I'm so _glad you're here tonight, because-you can be a great _help _to us all_._
(_PHYLLIS, very pleased, steps forward, so that she cannot see the dismay on the faces of the players, during :_)
PHYLLIS. Really? How?
GERRY. (_Realizing she's trapped herself, invents:_) Uh-why-you can listen to the lines, and see that everyone is doing them properly!
AGGIE. (_Steps Onstage, script in hand._) And where does that leave _me?_
GERRY. Oh, Aggie, I didn't mean the _words, _exactly -I meant all the-uh-subtle little _nuances _of their _interpretation!_
AGGIE. (_Waves script mildly._) The ones you forgot to tell _me _to mark down-?
GERRY. (_Wearily._) Yes.
PHYLLIS. Shall I sit out there beside you-?
GERRY. _No! . . . _That is-uh-I make _notes _all the time during rehearsal. I might distract you.
-46-
AGGIE. (_Starts off._) Louise,. have you got _a, chair _for our _playwright _back there-? (_Exits while we hear:_)
LOUISE. (_Off._) If _you've _got a _dust rag!_
PHYLLIS. (_Moving off after _AGGIE.) Oh, this is thrilling! Simply thrilling! (_Exits, and we hear immediately :_)
SAUL. (_To _GERRY, in _a lowered voice._) You got any _other _nice little surprises for us? _I _could use a thrill right now.
GERRY. (_Same level._) It'll be okay, Saul. Don't lose your temper.
BILLY. (_Same level._) What the hell are "nuances"?!
SAUL. (_Same level._) Don't ask. Just grit your teeth and pray you've _got _'em!
POLLY. (_To _GERRY, _same level._) I thought you wanted us to go straight through without interruption?! With _Phyllis _back there listening for _nuances-!_
SAUL. (_Same level._) Cheer up. Maybe Louise will drop a sandbag on her.
PHYLLIS. (_Off. Trills blithely._) I'm read-y . . .!
GERRY. (_Sits back and sinks down apprehensively._) Okay ! Louise-close the damn-close the curtain, and we'll start!
(_Curtain starts to close as PLAYERS move into position._)
LOUISE. (_Off._) You want the _music, _too?
GERRY. Of course! Everything exactly like the performance!
(_Curtain completes its close during:_)
AGGIE. (Off.) Everybody hold your places during the music-!
SMITTY. I'm _offstage _when the curtain rises. I don't _have _a place.
-47-
SAUL. (_Now masked from our view by the closed curtain._) You're _lucky!_
AGGIE. (_Off._) Quiet, everybody!
(_MUSIC-something dark and mysterious-starts_)
GERRY. The house lights! Louise, dim the house lights!
(_LIGHTS in theatre dim, _fully, _and will remain down for remainder of this act._)
GERRY. That's fine, Louise! Do it like that at the opening-right after the music starts!
LOUISE. (_Off._) Gotcha!
(_MUSIC finishes on a loud, ominous chord; curtain opens. [NOTE: The "Act One of _Murder Most Foul" _tableau is: _HENRY _at the sideboard pouring a drink, _VIOLET _at the bookcase between Upstage window and doorway, her back to us, seeking a book, and SMITTY using a feather duster on the front of the wall safe_)
SMITTY. (_As she dusts._) "Lord Dudley, will there be anyone at dinner tonight besides Sir Percival the famous archaeologist, Doctor Rex Forbes the famous scientist, and Stephen Sellers the famous millionaire?"
HENRY. "Other than myself and Lady Margaret, my wife, and the lovely socialite Diana Lassiter, here . . . no, Doris."
SMITTY. (_Starts toward Stage Right doorway, since she was only Onstage to ladle out vital information to the audience._) "That's what I _thought_." (_Exits._)
HENRY. (_Has his drink, holds it as he turns toward _VIOLET.) "I say, Diana, have you yet located that book on famous jewels of India that I told you must be there on the shelf?"
-48-
VIOLET. (_Who has been running a forefinger back and forth on the selfsame shelf during the opening lines, abruptly stops at a certain book._) "Ah, yes! Here it _is_!" (_Takes book, turns Downstage, flips it open at its very center, and immediately reacts to what she sees there._) "Oh! I say, Lord Dudley--you didn't tell me there was a_ curse _on the famous White Ruby of Ranchipur-?!"
PHYLLIS. (Off.) The _what?!_
GERRY. It's _all _right, Phyllis, it's all _right!_
PHYLLIS. (_Steps Onstage._) But that's supposed to be the Delhi Diamond!
GERRY. We had to change it, Phyllis.
PHYLLIS. For what _possible _reason?!
SAUL. (_Off._) It looked silly next to the liverwurst!
PHYLLIS. (_Looks uncertainly toward direction of his voice_.) _What _liverwurst? There's no _liverwurst _in my play !
VIOLET. We just wanted to _keep _it that way.
PHYLLIS. I beg your pardon?
GERRY. Phyllis! Trust me! Please go back off the stage, and Aggie will explain the change to you.
PHYLLIS. But-?
GERRY. _Please, _Phyllis? We _open _tomorrow night!
PHYLLIS. Well-I--oh, very well, very well! (_Exits; _GERRY _sinks back into seat._)
GERRY. Go ahead with the show, people.
SMITTY. (_Off._) From the top? I already put the feather duster away.
GERRY. No, no, no! Right from where we broke. 
HENRY. Oh, all right. Violet-would you-?
VIOLET. Oh, sure. (_Into character_.) ". . . the famous White Ruby of Ranchipur-?!"
HENRY. "Fiddlesticks! A lot of hogwash! Damned superstitious rot!"
VIOLET. (_Will close book and put it back on shelf as he speaks._) "But the book distinctly says that Lord Clyde Fortescue, the first owner of the Del-the White Ruby of Ranchipur-" (_Stops._) Gerry, can I just say "ruby"?! I hate to say the whole mouthful every time!
-49-
GERRY. Yes, yes, yes! Just go _on, _go _on!_
VIOLET. (_Back into character_.) "-distinctly says that Lord Clyde Fortescue, the first owner of the ruby, was found floating in his tub, in his own blood! And the next owner, Sir Giles Renfrew, had no sooner purchased the ruby from Lord Clyde's estate, when _he _was found in his stables, trampled to death by his favorite horse! And the _next _owner-"
HENRY. "Balderdash! Nonsense! A lot of old wives' tales!"
VIOLET. "How _can_ it be? They _are _all dead-aren't they?"
HENRY. "Yes, but consider: I bought the ruby this morning-and I'm fine!" (HENRY _suddenly puts a hand to his head and sways._)
VIOLET. "Lord Dudley-is anything wrong?"
HENRY. "No-no. Nothing. Just one of my beastly attacks."
VIOLET. "How long have you had them?"
HENRY. "Since this morning."
VIOLET. "You don't suppose-?"
HENRY. "Ridiculous! Sheer coincidence! Merest chance!"
SMITTY. (_Steps into room._) "Doctor Forbes is here, Lord Dudley."
HENRY. "Ah! It is your fiancé, Diana!" (_To _GERRY.) That's a pretty dumb line, isn't it? She _knows _he's her fiancé.
PHYLLIS. (Off.) But the audience doesn't!
SAUL. Why don't I just wear a signboard?
PHYLLIS. (_Off._) Now, really, Saul!
-50-
GERRY. Will you all stop your gabbing and get on with the _play?! _It's far too late to make alterations now!
HENRY. Oh, all right. ". . . It is your fiancé, Diana!"
VIOLET. "Yes, being engaged to the world-famous scientist has made me the envy of all the girls in England!"
HENRY. "Ah, but a lovely belle like you deserves to have a ring!"
VIOLET. Speaking of dumb lines!
GERRY. Violet-!
PHYLLIS. (Off.) That line is _supposed _to be lighthearted. The merriment provides emotional contrast with the atmosphere of terror.
SMITTY. That's the general _atmosphere, _all right.
GERRY. Will you all _please-?!_
VIOLET. Yes, yes, yes! (_Into character._) "You flatter me, Lord Dudley."
HENRY. "Doris, will you show the gentleman in?"
SMITTY. "At once, milord!" (_She exits and _SAUL _enters._)
SAUL. (_Bows, briefly._) "Lord Dudley. Diana."
HENRY. "I'm sure you young people will want to be alone." (_Starts toward Upstage doorway._) "I'll just toddle off to my room and putter about."
GERRY. Not that exit, Henry! That goes to the kitchen and the maid's quarters!
HENRY. Oh, that's right. (_Starts toward right doorway, but pauses short of exit._) Of course, she's quite a good-looking maid-!
POLLY. (Off.) Henry!
HENRY. Only joking, dear.
SMITTY. (Off.) You mean I'm _not _good-looking?
HENRY. Uh-well-um--
GERRY. Henry, just _finish _your line and _go!_
-51-
HENRY. Saul's got a line, first.
SAUL. I have? Oh! Right! . . . "Really, Lord Dudley, you needn't go."
HENRY. "Nonsense. I was once in love, myself !"
POLLY. (_Off._) Why does he say that in the past tense?!
GERRY. Polly, please-!
POLLY. (Off.) Sorry.
(HENRY _exits; _SAUL _moves to _VIOLET _and embraces her._)
SAUL. "My dearest darling!"
VIOLET. "My sweet!" (_They kiss, lightly, then stand apart._)
SAUL. "My darling, I have a little surprise-" (_Reaches into his pocket, then slumps._) Oh, damn!
GERRY. What's the matter?
SAUL. Forgot the stupid necklace! (_Starts Offstage._) Aggie--?!
AGGIE. (_Steps on, extending necklace._) Here. Sorry about that.
GERRY. Aggie, as stage manager, you're supposed to make certain everyone has all their props!
AGGIE. I know, I know. Phyllis was talking to me about "nuances" and I missed Saul's entrance.
GERRY. Phyllis-you really mustn't chat backstage when people have work to do.
PHYLLIS. (Off.) I do apologize, Geraldine. I forgot Agnes had things to do.
AGGIE. My fault for not reminding her. (_Exits, on:_) "Agnes"! Ye gods!
SAUL. Pick it up from where we left off?
GERRY. Good a spot as any.
SAUL. "My darling, I have a little surprise-the White Ruby of Ranchipur!"
-52-
VIOLET. "Oh! How incredibly lovely it is! Might I-. try it on?"
SAUL. "Not afraid of the curse?"
VIOLET. "Well-not _very _much . . . May I-please-?"
SAUL. "Certainly you shall. Here, allow me . . ." (_She turns, he hangs it about her neck, then turns her around to face him._) "It _is _lovely-in such a lovely _setting!"_
VIOLET. (_Lowers her eyes demurely, turns partly _away.) "Oh, Rex, what a thing to say-!"
SAUL. "I cannot decide which is lovelier, you or that fabulous gem."
VIOLET. "I simply must see myself in it-let me go find a mirror!" (_Starts toward right doorway, but stops as _POLLY _enters._)
POLLY. "Diana! That necklace! How dare you! Take it off at once!"
VIOLET. "Lady Margaret! I was only-"
POLLY. "Take it off, I say! This instant!"
SAUL. (_Helps _VIOLET _undo clasp._) "Here, now, Lady Margaret, there's surely no harm done . . . ?"
POLLY. "No harm, you say? How could you endanger the life of this dear girl-and your own fiancée!"
VIOLET. "Oh, I don't believe in that silly curse, Lady Margaret! After all, this _is _the twentieth century!" (VIOLET _suddenly places the back of one hand to her forehead and sways._)
SAUL. "Diana! Are you all right?"
VIOLET. "Yes-yes, I think so. It was just momentary-the room seemed to dip-my head started to spin-oh, but I'm quite all right, now."
POLLY. (_Takes necklace from SAUL._) "I shall place this where it can do no more harm!" (_Moves toward wall safe._)
SAUL. "Aren't you being silly, Lady Margaret?"
-53-
POLLY. (_Twirling dial of safe to open it._) "Perhaps I am. But it is better to be safe than sorry!"
SAUL. "Should you not at least wait until Lord Dudley has seen his newest possession?"
POLLY. "He shall see it in good time-when I feel brave enough to wear it. And do not forget-he purchased it for me-so it is in actuality mine to deal with as I choose!" (_Has safe open, thrusts necklace within -and we hear necklace CLATTER to floor beyond open back of safe._) Oh, dear, I pushed it too far!
PHYLLIS. (_Pops Onstage._) Do you mean to say there's no _back _on that thing?!
AGGIE. (_Enters, crosses to French doors, where she will exit during her line._) My fault, my fault! I forgot I was supposed to be back there to grab the damned thing!
GERRY. Aggie, I hope you're making _notes _of all these things!
AGGIE. (_Off._) Sure, sure. I just keep forgetting to _read _them!
POLLY. (_Wandering disconsolately away from safe._) We'll _never _be ready by tomorrow night! Never! We're here almost an hour already, and we're not even halfway through the first act!
AGGIE. (_Enters carrying necklace._) And we've only had two rehearsals of the third! And that's the most important act in the show!
BILLY. (_Steps Onstage._) Aggie's right. That's the act we're all really panicky about!
VIOLET. Why don't we _do _that act, right now! It's hard to do everything that comes before it, with that act hanging over our heads-if we felt more confident about it, I'm sure-
GERRY. All right, all right! _Anything _to get this show nailed down! Let's _do _the third act, get our confidence, and then run all three acts as fast as we can.
-54-
SMITTY. (_Steps Onstage._) How long will that take? My mother doesn't like me out too late on a school night. I just barely passed that biology exam.
GERRY. The sooner we begin, the sooner we'll finish! Come on, let's get moving!
(ALL _ad-lib assent; PLAYERS get into Act Three places, and NON-PLAYERS leave the stage._)
LOUISE. (Off.) Do you want it with the curtain?
GERRY. Not now, Louise! Wait'll we're running the entire show.
LOUISE. (_Off._) Okay, but hang on a second while I find the right spot on my tape!
GERRY. You've got nothing till that phone bell. Find your place while we run the act!
LOUISE. (_Off._) Well, I'll do my best!
GERRY. Go ahead, everybody. Top of Act Three!
(_PLAYERS brace themselves; then:_)
PHYLLIS. (_Off. A cry of triumph._) I've _got _it!
(_PLAYERS all lurch like standees on a streetcar which has come to an abrupt stop; _PHYLLIS _rushes Onstage._)
GERRY. Phyllis, you _can't _just interrupt _rehearsal _this way-!
PHYLLIS. But I've solved the problem of the liverwurst!
SAUL. Damn it, that's _already _been solved!
PHYLLIS. There's no need to use _profanity, _Saul!
SAUL. That's what _you _think!
PHYLLIS. _Please _hear me out-I was _so _concerned with the loss of my lovely double-alliteration . . . !
-55-
GERRY. (_Anything to get the show rolling._) All right, all right! Let's hear the solution, but be quick!
PHYLLIS. (_Excitedly._) We don't have to say "Delhi Diamond"-we call it the "Darjeeling Diamond"! Do you see? It's still named after a town in India, but now-
GERRY. I get it, I get it, thank you very much, we'll make the change, now please get off the stage and I don't want to see or hear you again until we've finished rehearsing this act, okay?!
PHYLLIS. You don't have to get huffy about it! (_Nose in air, exits from stage._)
GERRY. Has everybody got the new name for that stupid gem? (_PLAYERS al-lib assent._) Fine! Now-take it from the top of Act Three-and no stopping!
LOUISE. (_Off ._) What do you want to bet?
GERRY. _Please, _Louise-!
LOUISE. (_Off._) Okay. Just thought it was a great opportunity to pick up some extra cash!
GERRY. (_Just short of a roar._) Places! Everybody! And the _next _person who interrupts _dies! _I don't mean get-yelled-at . . . I don't mean chewed-out . . . I mean _dies!_
(_Terrified PLAYERS brace themselves in position._)
AGGIE. (Off.) On your marks-get set-go!
(_Out of sheer panic, PLAYERS will say all the following play-within-the-play lines at frantic double-speed, with heightened emotion in their tones, and physical movements correspondingly extra-quick, akin to players in a speeded-up movie film._)
VIOLET. "Ah, Lord Dudley, you give the most charming parties in the whole of England!"
-56-
HENRY. "You are too kind, Diana. A pity Sir Percival could not be here."
POLLY. "Do you know-I'm _worried _about Percival! He's never accepted an invitation to one of our parties and then not shown up-at least, not without sending word."
BILLY. "Ah, but Lady Margaret, he might have had motor trouble."
VIOLET. Yes, indeed. I do hope he hasn't had an _accident! _These roads can be treacherous at night."
(_SMITTY. rushes on, realizes she's early, gives a little gasp, then rushes out again; _POLLY _becomes distracted._)
POLLY. Uh-I-oh, damn it all to hell! (_Starts to cry, covers her face._)
GERRY. (_Stands _up.) Wait. Please. This is all my fault. I should be providing you with a pleasant atmosphere to work in, not strike terror into all your hearts. Just-take it from where you're at-and slow it down a little, okay-?
SAUL. Does that mean you're not going to kill Polly?
GERRY. (_With a slight edge._) Yes. But don't _you_ start feeling too secure!
SAUL. (_Takes a slight back step._) Uh-right.
GERRY. (_Resumes her seat._) Go ahead, Polly. The roads can be treacherous at night . . .
POLLY. (A _bit recovered._) My-my mind's gone blank. I can't think. I-
AGGIE. (Off. _Feeding the line in soothing ones._) Don't-say-such-a-thing-it-would-make-one-think-
POLLY. Oh, yes, of course! (_Back into character, at normal speed._) "Don't say such a thing! It would make one think that perhaps there was some truth, after all, in that story about the curse!"
-57-
HENRY. "Nonsense, my dear. There's no such thing as a curse."
BILLY. "And yet-everyone who has ever owned the Delhi-the ruby-the-" Wait, I'll get it-! ". . . the _Darjeeling _Diamond-has _always _met with a dreadful demise!"
PHYLLIS. (_Off._) Beautiful! Just beautiful!
ALL. _PHYLLIS!_
PHYLLIS. (_Off._) Sorry.
VIOLET. "But Percival doesn't own the diamond-the ruby-the _diamond_-anymore-not since he sold it to Lord Dudley for Lady Margaret's correction - connection - confection-?!"
AGGIE. (_Off._) _Collection!_
VIOLET. "-collection."
SAUL. "Nevertheless-Percival _did _own it-and that might be enough."
BILLY. "See here, Doctor Fubbs-Forbes-!"
GERRY. Stop! . . . Everybody take a deep breath and relax. (_PLAYERS all do so._) Fine. Now just go on, and enjoy yourselves!
BILLY. "-you are a man of science-surely _you _don't believe in curses?"
SAUL. "I only know there are strange things in the history of India-things which defy rational explanation."
HENRY. "Nonsense. Sheer pockycop-_pock_-eecop-!" _Aaaaagh! _"Poppycock! . . . Superstitious drivel !"
SAUL. "Quite poppably-" Oh, damn it, _damn it, _DAMN IT!
GERRY. (_Amiably._) Relax. You're all still too tense. Slow and easy does it.
SAUL. (_Takes a breath, continues._) "Quite _possibly, _Lord Dudley-and yet-"
POLLY. "And yet-?"
-58-
SAUL. _"Where _is Sir Percival?"
VIOLET. "Frankly, I'm _glad _he's not here!"
POLLY. "Why, Diana, what a thing to say!"
VIOLET. "I mean it. Sir Percival is-no gentleman."
HENRY. "Here, now, what are you saying?"
VIOLET. (_Without noticing that she's blowing her line._) "When he looks at me-I feel as though his pants were moving all over my body." (_Other PLAYERS guffaw almost convulsively, turning away from her, unable to control their laughter._) What's the matter?
GERRY. It's his "hands," Violet, his "hands"!
VIOLET. Isn't that what I said?
BILLY. (_A bit more in control._) You said "pants."
VIOLET. Oh! (_Starts to giggle._)
GERRY. Look, everyone, fun is fun, but _we would _like Smitty to get home sometime before _dawn!_
VIOLET. Right. I'm sorry. (_Her face will twitch a bit, as will those of the other PLAYERS, as she says her line correctly-but we all know what they are remembering._) ". . . _I feel _as though his _hands _were moving all over my body."
POLLY. (_Still in the throes of that blown version._) "B-but-he is a knight of the-" (_Suppressing a laugh, makes a sound like a raspberry; other PLAYERS break up helplessly._)
GERRY. (_Sternly, quietly._) That's it-laugh it up-we'll see just how funny you think this is tomorrow night . . . !
(_This sobers them; they regain control, fast._)
POLLY. ". . . a knight of the realm!"
VIOLET. "He is a disgusting toad. And such toads can be lecherous at night!"
-59-
(_There is a pause; PLAYERS slowly, covertly, look toward still-empty right doorway; then _SMITTY _gallops onstage, only about two seconds late._)
SMITTY. "Begging-your-pardon-milord-"
GERRY. Take it easy, take it easy, you'll be just fine.
SMITTY. (_A bit slower_.) "-but should we delay dinner any longer?"
HENRY. "Mmm-no, I think not. Can't wait for Percival forever." (_Moves toward _POLLY.) "Shall we, my dear?"
POLLY. "I suppose so. But-don't you think someone should call Percival's flat and ascertain the reason for his absence?"
BILLY. (_Moves around armchair to take _VIOLET'S _arm as she rises._) "Do you know-that might be a sound idea. There is something distinctly odd about all of this."
VIOLET. "All of what, Stephen?"
BILLY. "This business about Percival and the necklace. He _did _say he was bringing it tonight, Lady Margaret?"
POLLY. "Well, actually, I-I-" (_Stops, frowning._)
GERRY. _Now _what's the matter?
POLLY. I just thought-_Saul_ brings the necklace, in the first act, and I put it in the safe-so how can I say-?
PHYLLIS. (_Off._) Oh, dear! Oh, dear-oh-dear! (_Rushes Onstage._) I forgot to give you the new line! When I rewrote the first act, a few weeks back, I completely forgot about that line in _this act!_
GERRY. This is a hell of a time to think of it! What's the new line?
PHYLLIS. I-I don't have the rewrite _with _me-!
GERRY. _Approximately, _then! (_Will get up and move up onto the stage._) We don't have time for a lot of fooling around with words! Just give us the _gist _of it and we'll improvise!
-60-
PHYLLIS. Well-um-Polly's line is basically the same-only she says something to Billy about him not being here when Saul brought the necklace, instead of Percival, do you see?
GERRY. Can you handle that, Polly?
POLLY. I-I think so-let me try it . . .
GERRY. Okay. Just get on with this thing! (_Starts Offstage._) I need a cup of coffee. Louise-is there any coffee back there?
LOUISE. (_Off._) For want of a better name.
GERRY. (_Sighs._) It'll have to do. Come along, Phyllis. The rest of you get back to work! (GERRY _and _PHYLLIS _exit; PLAYERS get back in place, and:_)
POLLY. Feed me your line again, Billy-?
BILLY. Uh . . what the hell is it? . . . Oh, yeah! . . . "-He _did _say he was bringing it tonight, Lady Margaret?"
POLLY. "Well, actually, I never spoke with him directly-but there was a message delivered this morning in the post-saying-" Uh. "-saying that he'd asked Doctor Forbes to bring it _for _him!"
SMITTY. "What, on Saint Swithin's Day?"
SAUL. Wait a minute, wait a minute! That sounds as it it's against the law to _ask _somebody to _deliver _things on that day-the part about the post has to come last, Polly.
POLLY. Let me try it again . . . "-but Doctor Forbes told me that Percival had asked _him _to deliver it, in a message delivered this morning in the post!"
SAUL. Ah, much better! Go ahead, Smitty.
SMITTY. "What, on Saint Swithin's Day?" (SAUL _guffaws._)
GERRY. (_Off_.) _Now _what?!
SAUL. I'm sorry. It sounded like she couldn't go _ahead _on-
-61-
GERRY. (Off. _Truly angry._) I don't give a good damn _what _it sounded like! If all you three-year-olds want to play _games _instead of learning this _play-!_
SAUL. (_Much chastened._) I'm sorry, Gerry. Go on, Smitty, please.
SMITTY. (_Grimly_.) "-_Saint _Swithin's Day!"
HENRY. "By Jove! Never thought of that! Margaret - are you _certain _about that message?"
POLLY. "Why-come to think of it-no."
VIOLET. "You _didn't _receive a message?"
POLLY. "Oh, yes-I did-but now I wonder if it were actually from Percival!"
BILLY. "But it did come by post?"
POLLY. "I-I assumed it had-but-"
HENRY. "Assumed? You mean, you didn't actually see it?"
POLLY. "Why, no."
(_PLAYERS are now "into rhythm" with their play, and do their roles well until the interruption._)
VIOLET. "Then how did you know its content?"
POLLY. "Why-Doctor Forbes told me what it had said."
SAUL. "Is there any reason I shouldn't have?"
BILLY. "No, no, of course not, old chap. Only-if there was no delivery of the post, today, then how-?"
SAUL. "It was not a letter. It was a telegram." 
BILLY. "I should like very much to _see _that telegram!"
SAUL. "Well-as a matter of fact-I don't have it. The message was phoned from the telegraph office."
BILLY. "Doris-have there been any telephone messages this evening?"
SAUL. "See here, you insolent young pup! Are you doubting my word? !"
POLLY. "Of course he isn't, Rex! Stephen, you should apologize to Doctor Forbes."
-62-
BILLY. "Oh, I shall. As soon as Doris answers my question."
SMITTY. "No, sir."
POLLY. "What, are you quite sure?"
SMITTY. "The telephone has been out of order since this _afternoon, _mum."
BILLY. "Aha! And what do you say to _that, _Doctor Forbes?"
(_There is a silence; PLAYERS slowly look toward the silent telephone, waiting; nothing happens; then:_)
LOUISE. (_Off._) Damn it all to hell! Phyllis, what have you done?!
PHYLLIS. (_Off._) What have _I _done? What are you talking about? Did I get the phone bell out of order on the tape?
GERRY. (_Off_.) What were _you_ doing with the _tape, _Phyllis?!
PHYLLIS. (_Off._) Why-I just thought I'd give a listen to the sound-effects and-
LOUISE. (_Off._) _And you erased the tape_! (_PLAYERS Onstage all slump, and ad-lib mutters of despair._) There's _nothing _on it! _Nothing!_
GERRY. (_Off_.) Oh, Louise, are you _sure-?!_
LOUISE. (_Off_.) Listen for yourself!
GERRY. (_Off._) _I _don't hear anything-?
LOUISE. (_Off._) That's what I _mean!_
(_From the wings, we hear ad-libs of _PHYLLIS _wailing all sorts of apologies, _GERRY _trying to make peace, _AGGIE _bemoaning the future of the show, and _LOUISE _raising hell-all overlapping one another; then _LOUISE, _with a reel of recording tape, comes Onstage, crossing toward far side and the Backstage exit._)
POLLY. Louise! You're not leaving?
-63-
LOUISE. (_Stops, Center Stage._) Can't do a damn thing for you if I _stay! _I've got to get home and re tape every one of those sound-effects for the opening! (_Shouts Offstage._) And if that bubble-brained idiot so much as comes _near _my machine again, I'm gonna beat her _head _in with it! (_She turns to continue her cross, but stops as GERRY-followed _by a _weepily contrite PHYLLIS_-hastens _Onstage._)
GERRY. Listen-as long as you _have _to do it all over, Louise-I've been thinking-perhaps we should have the telephone _hooked up-to _a button backstage-there are so many phone-calls in this show-wouldn't it be easier to ring the phone manually?
LOUISE. Well . . . yes, I guess it would-and it'd save me a lot of work tonight if I could leave those rings off the tape-
AGGIE. (_Enters_.) _I _can do the hookup. The end of the wire's already backstage, and there's a storage battery, too, for power.
LOUISE. (_A bit calmer._) Okay. Just make sure you put the button somewhere near the tape-recorder, so I don't have to leave the sound-board to find it.
AGGIE. Of course. (_Turns and exits._)
LOUISE. _Oh, _and the rest of you- (_PLAYERS turn their attention to her._) Remember one thing: When you _use _the phone in the play-be _sure _you hang it _up_ right! If it's sitting the wrong way, so the buttons aren't depressed by the speaker-part, the phone can't ring, got it? (_PLAYERS ad-lib assent._) Okay. Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a hell of a lot of work to do! (_Completes her cross and exits._)
PHYLLIS. I'm so dreadfully sorry. I feel I owe each and every one of you an apology for what I've done-
GERRY. (_Takes her arm and starts leading her Offstage._) Write it down and _mail _it to them! (_As they exit:_)
-64-
SAUL. (_Under his breath._) Preferably on Saint Swithin's Day!
(_Then all PLAYERS react as PHONE RINGS._)
AGGIE. (_Off._) How's _that _for fast work!
GERRY. (_Off._) Beautiful, Aggie, just beautiful! You deserve a cup of coffee for that.
AGGIE. (_Off._) I'll settle for that stuff Louise brews.
SAUL. Shall we go on, or what?
GERRY. (_Off._) Go on, or _else!_
AGGIE. (_Off._) They need their cue.
(_PHONE RINGS._)
SAUL. "Does _that _answer your question?"
POLLY. "Stephen, I believe you owe Doctor Forbes an apology."
HENRY. (_After a pause._) Aggie-?
AGGIE. (_Off._) Oh, sorry! I was drinking my swill!
(_PHONE RINGS again._)
HENRY. "You had best answer that, Doris, before we owe the _caller _an apology, too!"
SMITTY. (_Moves to phone._) "Yes, sir!" (_Answers._) "Hello-? . . . Who? . . . Why, yes, he is. Just a moment." (_Hands phone to _HENRY.) "It's for you, sir."
HENRY. "Who is it, Doris?"
SMITTY. "Sir Percival."
SAUL. "It _can't _be-! . . . I mean-"
BILLY. "Yes, Doctor? Exactly what _do _you mean?"
SAUL. "Why-I-I-"
HENRY. (_On phone._) "Hello? . . . What? . . . Ah! Yes, I see . . . Yes, thank you! Thank you very much! (_Hangs up._)
-65-
POLLY. "Why-Dudley--you look so strange! What did Percival _say?"_
HENRY. (_Grimly._) "That was _not _Sir Percival!" (_PHONE RINGS._) What the hell-?
GERRY. (_Off._) Aggie!
AGGIE. (_Off._) Sorry ! I put my coffee cup down on the button!
GERRY. (_Off._) Go on, people, go on!
HENRY. (_Grimly._) "That was _not _Sir Percival!"
POLLY. "Then-who was it?"
BILLY. "That was Miles Taylor, a good friend of mine."
VIOLET. "Stephen, I do not understand."
POLLY. "Nor I."
BILLY. "It is very simple. I asked Miles to ring up and say he was Sir Percival, so that I could observe the effect it would have upon Doctor Forbes. I think you will all agree that he was struck dumbfounded."
SAUL. "Nonsense!"
HENRY. "It is _not _nonsense, sir! I myself observed the selfsame reaction"
VIOLET. "But-what does it _mean?"_
POLLY. "Yes, what _does _it all mean?"
SMITTY. "Yes, what can it _possibly mean?"_
HENRY. "Doris, you are forgetting your place."
SMITTY. "Sorry, milord."
BILLY. _"I _can explain what it means! It means that this man, after murdering Sir Percival for the necklace-"
SAUL. "How dare you, sir! I'll have you in court for this! Such accusations are actionable! To tarnish my good name-it's libelous!"
BILLY. "I cannot be sued successfully for libel if my accusations should prove true!"
SAUL. (_Sneers._) "And just how do you _intend _to prove them true?"
-66-
BILLY. "Quite easily, after a look at that necklace. Would you mind getting it, Doctor Forbes?"
SAUL. "The necklace? There is no proof on that necklace. I'll show you! (_Steps to safe, dials combination, reaches inside_.) _Aggie!_
AGGIE. (Off.) Oh, golly, I forgot! (_We see her cross doorway, Upstage, pass through area Upstage of window, pass French doors, during:_) I won't forget tomorrow night! I swear I won't! Things have just been kind of hectic, with Phyllis here, and-
GERRY. (_Steps Onstage._) Aggie, don't cross where the audience can _see _you!
AGGIE. (_Now out of our view near back of safe._) I won't, I won't. I was just in a hurry!
GERRY. (_Eyes skyward._) Heaven help us all! (_Exits._)
SAUL. From my line-?
GERRY. (Off.) From _anywhere!_
SAUL. ". . . I'll show you!" (_Reaches arm into safe almost up to the armpit._) Aggie, can't you stand a little closer?!
AGGIE. (_Off._) Sorry, Saul.
SAUL. (_Hand emerges with necklace._) "There! Now show me your ridiculous proof !"
BILLY. "You yourself have shown the proof, Doctor Forbes! For-if you are _not _the murderer-how did you know the combination to that _safe?!"_
POLLY. "Great heavens! He's right!"
SAUL. "Blast you, Stephen Sellers!" (_Whips out pistol._) "But there is one thing you did not take into account! I am armed!"
HENRY. "You, sir, are a scoundrel !"
VIOLET. "And I should very much like to sunder our engagement this moment!"
BILLY. "In that case-will you marry _me, _Diana_?"_
VIOLET. "With all my heart, Stephen!" (_They do _a _four-hand clasp and stare adoringly into one another's eyes._)
-67-
POLLY. "Doris-telephone at once for the constabulary!"
SAUL. (_Aims pistol._) "Do so and you are dead, my dear!"
SMITTY. "Oh, mum, what shall I do?"
SAUL. "Just raise your hands. And the rest of you do likewise!" (_All stand there a moment; then:_) Aggie! The telephone's supposed to ring there!
AGGIE. (_Enters through French doors._) I clean forgot! This is going to be _hell _tomorrow night, dashing to the safe with the necklace, then dashing back to ring the phone-not to mention following in the script so I can _cue _people!
PHYLLIS. (_Off_.) _I _can pass the necklace to him, tomorrow night, if you like! I'd feel much safer having it in my possession, anyhow.
GERRY. (_Off._) But won't you be seated out front?
PHYLLIS. (Off.) I can come up for that part-I'll have to be backstage, anyhow, so I can come out for my bow.
GERRY. (Off.) Well-I don't know . . .
AGGIE. (_Has finished cross, will exit on:_) We'll hash that out later! Right now, let's get _on _with this thing!
SAUL. Okay! (_Into character_.) ". . . And the rest of you do likewise!" (_PHONE RINGS._) "Damn and blast! Who's that?"
BILLY. "It is my friend, Miles Taylor. I told him to ring us back shortly after his first call. If I do not answer-he shall summon the law, and they shall arrive here with a warrant for your arrest-Stanley Grimes!" 
POLLY & VIOLET. (_In rhythmic unison._) "Stanley Grimes?! Do you mean that criminal laboratory assistant to Doctor Forbes?!"
BILLY. "To the _late _Doctor Forbes, unless I miss my guess!" (_OTHERS-except _SAUL, _of course-gasp._) "You are done with your fiendish felonies, Grimes. Put down that pistol and surrender!"
-68-
SAUL. "Never! I may go to the gallows-but none of you in this room will live to see it!"
SMITTY. (_To _HENRY.) Please, milord-might I leave the room?"
SAUL. "Stand where you are! But-before I destroy you all-I must know-how did you come to suspect me, Sellers?"
BILLY. "I arrived here late, as you all know. As a result, I had time to hear the news broadcast which told of the finding of Sir Percival's body-dead of a rare Indian cobra poison. You, of course, had already disconnected the telephone here at the switchbox, so no one else would hear the news. But when I accidentally knocked down your overcoat as I was hanging up my own-and found a flagon of that very poison in the pocket-why then, I _knew _of course. I immediately reconnected the telephone, rang up Miles, set up our plan, and-"
VIOLET. "Excuse me, my dearest darling, but-_what_ did you know when you found this foul fiend's flagon?"
BILLY. "Why, how this man had schemed to keep alive the legend of that curse! He had immersed the necklace in the cobra venom, so that all who handled it would shortly become ill. He thought in that way to devalue it, to make Lady Margaret loathe the sight of it-and then, of course, he could have it for considerably less than its real value, so anxious would she be to sell the bauble!"
POLLY. "And I _would _have been, too! Oh, curse you, Stanley Grimes!"
SAUL. "Curse? Bah! There are no such things as curses! And I have soaked my hands in an antitoxin to prevent penetration of that potent poison, too!"
-69-
(_From Offstage, we hear _AGGIE _improvising vocally the "Rrrrrrr" of a POLICE SIREN._)
SAUL. What the hell is that?!
AGGIE. (_Off._) You get _real _sirens _tomorrow _night!
(_PLAYERS shake their heads, then plow doggedly on._)
BILLY. "Aha! My delaying tactics have done their work! The law is upon you, Stanley Grimes! Surrender yourself !"
SAUL. "Never! I shall take this necklace, sell it for a fortune, and move wealthily to another country!" (_Abruptly staggers, clutches his heart._) "Oh! Oh! Oh!"
POLLY. "It's the curse! The curse of the - the-the -" Oh, damn it!
HENRY. "Darjeeling Diamond," dear.
POLLY. Thanks, Henry. ". . . the curse of the Darjeeling Diamond!"
(SAUL _drops gun, falls "dead"; _HENRY _rushes to him, takes his pulse, shakes his head._)
HENRY. "He's dead!"
POLLY. (_Raises forefinger, takes Statue-of-Liberty stance._) "Yes. He mocked the laws of society-and now, a higher power has intervened!"
VIOLET. "Oh, Stephen-hold me, hold me!"
(BILLY _embraces her, she pillows her head on his shoulder._)
AGGIE. (_Off._) Curtain! Shall I lower it, Gerry?
GERRY. (_Coming Onstage._) Hell, no ! We're only just begun! Okay, you've _had _your third act! Now-from the top of Act One! It's already half-past ten!
-70-
SMITTY. My mother is going to _murder me!_
PHYLLIS. (_Steps blithely Onstage, smiles brightly, and trills:_) Ah, but my dear, it is _in such _a good _cause_! (_And as ALL OTHERS stare at her in disbelief-_)
(_THE CURTAIN FALLS_) 
!ACT III
-71-
(_At curtain-rise, we find PLAYERS in curtain-call positions, but a bit farther Upstage, since _GERRY _is standing before them, her back to us. PLAYERS are garbed as we last saw them, but now _VIOLET _wears her wig, and it fits, and all are wearing makeup. [NOTE: Our _real _cast has had makeup all along, of course, but now their _makeup looks _like makeup-too much lip-rouge on the men, too much cheek-rouge on the women, etc., so that they look like people in a play look to each other in closeup-but now we have the benefit of the make-believe as well.] _GERRY _is in a dressy dress, and wearing a corsage._)
GERRY. Well-this is _it, _gang! Any moment, now, they're going to open the doors and let the audience in.
SMITTY. Do they _have _to? (_OTHERS laugh._) I'm not sure I'm kidding-I'm really getting scared.
GERRY. That's _good, _Smitty. The worst way to approach a performance is with complacency. Nervousness gives a player energy.
SMITTY. Well, nervousness is giving _this _player creeping _paralysis! _Aggie may have to _push me _onstage!
AGGIE. (_Enters from wings, _carrying _script._) And don't think I won't. I used to be a sergeant in the Paratroops. Everybody jumped-whether they wanted to or not.
SAUL. I'm not nervous about the _regular _audience-if we goof, they'll probably never know it-what's giving _me _cold sweat is the thought of looking out front and seeing _Gerry_! She'll recognize every error!
-72-
GERRY. Then relax. I won't _be _out front tonight. I'll be right backstage here-helping Aggie push!
POLLY. How come? Don't you _want _to see the show -not that I blame you!
GERRY. Maybe _tomorrow _night. Tonight, _Phyllis _will be out front. If I sit out there, she'll want to be _next _to me-I don't think I could take that.
AGGIE. That reminds me-she still insists on being behind the safe to hand Saul that necklace! It saves me busting my behind galloping from the safe back to help Louise at the sound-board-but I'm afraid she may get so wrapped up in listening to her play she may forget!
GERRY. If she does, this play will end with a _real _murder I
(_LOUISE enters from Backstage-door side, carrying tape._)
LOUISE. Well-I did it. Took me till damn near three o'clock in the morning, but I got all those sounds back in order on the tape, finally !
AGGIE. I hope you skipped the phone bells-?
LOUISE. Don't worry. But I _did _add thunder-and-lightning effects.
GERRY. But-why? There's no thunderstorm in this play !
LOUISE. Who ever heard of a murder mystery without a thunderstorm?! Believe me, we're gonna need it.
GERRY. Louise, are you crazy? There's no spot in the play to _have _it!
LOUISE. What do you want to bet?
GERRY. I've been through this play a hundred times -I _know _there's no place to hear a thunderstorm! You'll distract the actors!.
LOUISE. Gerry-I guarantee you-there's a _perfect _spot for a thunderstorm-effect in this show, and it _won't _distract the actors!
-73-
GERRY. Where?!
LOUISE. That's gonna be my surprise. (_OTHERS ad-lib "Oh, now, Louise-!" or like expostulations._) Trust me! Have I ever let you down?
GERRY. But there's _no way _you can-
LOUISE. Make it easy on yourself. Bet me a dollar.
GERRY. (_After a pause._) You're on!
LOUISE. (_Starts off toward sound-board side of stage._) If there's one thing I love, it's a sucker-bet! (_Exits._)
PHYLLIS. (Off.) Yoo-hoo-!' (ALL _react._)
SAUL. That's what I hate about stages-there's no place to hide!
PHYLLIS. (_Enters from stage-door side; she wears an evening gown and a corsage._) Hel-_lo_, hel-_lo_, hel-_lo_! The magical moment is upon us at last!
GERRY. And so will our audience be, if we don't get this curtain closed!
LOUISE. (_Off._) Will do! (_Curtain will close, slowly, during :_)
PHYLLIS. (_Moving hurriedly forward and Offstage_.) _I _just wanted to wish you all the best of luck!
SAUL. In show business, that's bad luck to do! You're supposed to say, "Break a leg!"
PHYLLIS. (_Offstage, and moving toward her seat._) I'll never understand the theatre.
HENRY. That's a fine thing for our _playwright _to say!
(_Curtain is now closed, but we can still hear Onstage:_)
GERRY. The audience is coming in, now-would you all like to join me in prayer?
VIOLET. I'll say!
-74-
BILLY. We could _use a _miracle!
GERRY. Saint Genesius-pray for us!
ALL. Saint Genesius-pray for us!
GERRY. Okay, places, everyone-I'm going offstage. 
SMITTY. Saul-who's Saint Genesius?
SAUL. The patron saint of actors-he performed for the Roman Emperor and they had him put to death.
SMITTY. Oh, boy. I hope there are no emperors, out front tonight!
SAUL. Amen!
(_MUSIC STARTS; at climax, curtain opens on Act One tableau of "Murder Most Foul," as before._)
SMITTY. (_Feather-dusting safe like crazy._) "Lord Dudley, will there be anyone at dinner tonight besides Sir Percival the famous archaeologist, Doctor Rex Forbes the famous scientist, and Stephen Sellers the famous millionaire?"
HENRY. "Other than myself and Lady Margaret, my wife, and the lovely socialite Diana Lassiter, here . . . no, Doris."
SMITTY. (_Starts toward doorway, right._) "That's what I _thought_." (_Exits, and from Offstage, we hear her give a loud_:) _Whew!_
HENRY. (_Reacts slightly, then plunges onward._) "I say, Diana, have you yet located that book on famous jewels of India that I told you must be there on the shelf?"
VIOLET. (_Finding book she has been deliberately overlooking._) "Ah, yes! Here it is!" (_Faces him, flips book open, reacts._) "Oh, I say_, _Lord Dudley-you didn't tell me there was _a curse _on the Ranchipur _Delhi-I _mean the Darjeeling Ruby_-Diamond!"_
HENRY. (_Trying to save her._) It is known by many names, my dear!
-75-
VIOLET. It is? . . . Oh, yes, it, certainly is! Lots of 'em.
HENRY. (_Reverts to his normal line, not realizing it no longer fits, especially as' a response to _VIOLET.) "Fiddlesticks! A lot of hogwash!" (_Realizes._) That _curse, _I _mean! . . . _"Damned superstitious rot!" (VIOLET, by _now totally "up," just stares at him; he desperately reverse-feeds her line to her._) But-doesn't the book distinctly say-?
VIOLET. (_Home at last._) Yes! "But the book distinctly says that Lord Clyde Fortescue, the first owner of the-the Darjeeling Diamond -was found floating in his tub-!" Uh-I don't mean the _diamond _was found floating in his tub!
HENRY. No-no, of course not. But-what _was? _Eh?
VIOLET. _He _was! "In his own blood!" (_Stops._) 
HENRY. (_Prompts._) And the next owner-?
VIOLET. (_Back on the track._) "And the next owner, Sir Giles Renfrew, had no sooner purchased the ruby -the diamond-from Lord Clyde's estate, when _he _was found floating in his own stables by his favorite horse! . . . _Trampled, _I mean! (_In front row, _PHYLLIS _gives an audible moan; _VIOLET _flashes a frantic look that way, then slogs onward:_) "And the _next _owner-"
HENRY. (_Forgets he's supposed to interrupt; belatedly remembers._) "Balderdash! Nonsense! A lot of old wives' tales!"
VIOLET. (_Eliding her line a bit._) They're all dead, aren't they? . . . The owners. Not the old wives.
HENRY. "Yes, but consider: I bought the ruby this morning-and I'm fine!" (_Starts to put hand to his head, realizes and corrects:_) "The diamond!" (_Hand to head again, sways._)
VIOLET. "Lord Dudley-is anything wrong?"
PHYLLIS. (_Just audible._) Everything! Everything!
HENRY. (_As if he hadn't heard-but we can see he had._) "No-no. Nothing. Just one of my beastly attacks."
-76-
VIOLET. (_Jumping ahead two speeches._) "You don't suppose-?"
HENRY. (_Determined to get his line in._) Don't you wonder how long I've been having them?!
VIOLET. Oh! "How long have you had them?"
HENRY. "Since this morning."
VIOLET. (_Totally lost, improvises._) That long, huh?
HENRY. (_Controlling his rage._) Do you suppose that I suppose-?!
VIOLET. "You don't suppose-?"
HENRY. "Ridiculous! Sheer coincidence! Merest chance!"
(SMITTY _bolts Onstage, and since their panic is contagious:_)
SMITTY. Doctor Dud is here, Lord Forbley!
HENRY. (_Staggered, inflects as though naming the fiancé:_) "Ah! It is your fiancé_ Diana_!" (_Both women stare at him_.) "-_your fiancé_, Diana!"
(_PHYLLIS sighs audibly._)
VIOLET. "Yes, being engaged to the world-famous scientist has made me the envy of all the girls in London-in _England-in London, England!"_
HENRY. (_"Up."_) Uh.
SMITTY. (_After a moment, tries to help by saying his line._) "Ah, but a lovely belle like you deserves to be rung!" (_Thinks._) "-to have a ring!"
VIOLET. (_To _SMITTY, _naturally._) "You flatter me, Lord Dudley."
HENRY. Uh.
AGGIE. (_Off. Giving him his line, in a hoarse whisper._) "Doris-will-you-show-the-gentleman-in"!
-77-
SMITTY. (_Before he can even echo the cue._) "At once, milord!" (_She exits; no one enters._)
AGGIE. (_Off_.) _Saul!_
SAUL. (_Off._) Coming! (_Dashes Onstage, gives clumsy bow._) "Lord Dudley. Diana."
HENRY. "I'm sure you young people will want to be alone. I'll just toddle off to my room and putter about." (_As in earlier error, moves to Upstage doorway, starts to exit Right, but stops as we all hear :_)
GERRY. (Off.) You're going the wrong way!
HENRY. Oh! (_Turns full about and exits Left, instead, so that we see him passing Upstage of the window as he goes._)
SAUL. (_Who has seen this, of course._) He-he must be going to use the _outside _stairway!
VIOLET. (_Likewise._) Yes. That must be it. (_Pause._) Well-
SAUL. (_Galvanized back into character, shouts window-ward:_) "Really, Lord Dudley, you needn't go."
HENRY. (_From in back of garden-backdrop, where he is working his way toward Stage Right wings-and will wobble the Upstage corridor wall in the process._) "Nonsense. I was once in love, myself !" (_We hear him STUMBLE and FALL_.) _Damn _it!
SAUL. (_Rushes to _VIOLET, _quickly._) "My dearest darling!"
VIOLET. "My sweet!" (_They kiss lightly, then stand apart._)
SAUL. "My darling, I have a little surprise-' (_Starts frantically feeling his empty pockets._)
PHYLLIS. Oh, dear! (_Jumps up, exits up aisle, and while she is making her way to the Backstage area, our duo ad-libs desperately :_)
VIOLET. I like surprises.
SAUL. I kinda thought you did.
VIOLET. I can't wait to find out what it is.
SAUL. It's really worth waiting for.
-78-
VIOLET. I'm so excited.
SAUL. I knew you would be_._
VIOLET. Can't find it, huh?
SAUL. (_Inspired_.) _I _know! I must have, left it in my coat! Excuse me! (_Rushes out right doorway; _VIOLET, _nothing to do and nobody to talk to, stands awhile swinging her arms back and forth, and whistling, all the while we hear:_) The necklace! Where the hell's the necklace?!
AGGIE. (_Off._) Phyllis has it! I forgot to get it from her!
(_We hear footsteps, and:_)
PHYLLIS. (Off.) Here it is! I'm so terribly sorry!
SAUL. (_Off._) Just give it to me! (_Rushes Onstage, then realizes he holds :_)
PHYLLIS. (_Off._) My evening bag!
SAUL. (_To _VIOLET.) Whoops! Wrong surprise! (_Dashes off, and we hear:_) I hope you're satisfied! _Now _they think Doctor Forbes is _a sissy_! (_Dashes back on with necklace, waves it wearily._) Surprise! "-the White Ruby of Ranchipur!" Or _whatever _it is!
VIOLET. "Oh! How incredibly lovely it is! Might I-try it on?"
SAUL. (_Slowly sliding into character._) "Not afraid of the curse?"
VIOLET. "Well-not _very _much . . . May I-please-?"
SAUL. "Certainly you shall. Here, allow me . . ." (_She turns, he hangs it about her neck, but does not quite get the catch in place, and it slides right out of sight into the bosom of her dress as he turns her around to face him and says his line "on automatic":_) "It _is _lovely-in such a lovely _setting_!" (_Realizes he can't see it; without thinking, leans forward to peer down into her cleavage; _VIOLET _slaps both palms to the area and turns desperately away._)
-79-
VIOLET. "Oh, Rex, what a thing to say-!"
SAUL. (_Staring at the back of her head._) "I cannot decide which is lovelier, you or that fabulous gem."
(_PHYLLIS will come down the aisle and regain her seat, tiptoeing so as not to disturb anyone, during :_)
VIOLET. (_Both hands frantically groping in her cleavage._) "I simply-must see-myself in it-let me -go find a mirror!" (_Starts toward right doorway, still groping, but stops and drops her hands as _POLLY _enters._)
POLLY. "Diana! That necklace-!" (_Doesn't see it, and doesn't know where it is, either._) Where _is _it?
VIOLET. (_Points demurely into depths of her cleavage._) In here.
POLLY. (_Dazed, but dogged._) "How dare you! Take it out at once! . . . _-off _at once!"
SAUL. (_Desperately trying to get necklace, while _VIOLET _just as desperately tries to keep his hands off her_.) _I'll _get it!
POLLY. (_Improvising._) Well, hurry it up!
VIOLET. (_Gets necklace out with an effort, extends it to _POLLY.) There! "Lady Margaret! I was only-" 
POLLY. "Take it off, I say! This instant!"
SAUL. (_Grabs it from _VIOLET.) "Here, now, Lady Margaret, there's surely no harm done . . .?"
(_PHYLLIS gives an audible moan._)
(NOTE: This next bit is tricky, so pay attention: We _must _indicate that first act get finished, but we of course do not have time to do an _entire _play in this remaining act, so here is how it is accomplished: From here on, dialogue is _pre-taped _and will be _lip-synced _by PLAYERS-at _double speed _-simultaneous with _a strobe-light _being used to illustrate stage, so that the PLAYER's speeded-up movements will look even jerkier-and-at the indicated spot-the _curtain will close, _even though the action and dialogue continues. Ready? Here goes:)
-80-
POLLY. "No harm, you say? How could you endanger the life of this dear girl-and your own fiancée!"
VIOLET. "Oh, I don't believe in that silly curse, Lady Margaret! After all, this _is _the twentieth century!" (_Places back of hand to forehead, sways._)
SAUL. "Diana! Are you all right?"
(_CURTAIN STARTS TO CLOSE, SLOWLY._)
VIOLET. (_The volume of pre-taped speech will dwindle, fast, to total silence, during her line:_) "Yes-yes, I think so. It was just momentary-the room seemed to dip-my head started to spin . . ."
(_In the silence, we hear:_)
AGGIE. (_Off._) Places for Act Two, everybody!
(_MUSIC STARTS, and CURTAIN OPENS on _VIOLET, _seated on sofa; _BILLY _enters as MUSIC FADES; pace and voices are "live" and normal, now._)
BILLY. "Oh! Diana. I was seeking Lady Margaret."
VIOLET. "Lady Margaret is cutting roses in the garden, Stephen." (_Demurely folds hands in lap._) "She-may not return for some time."
-81-
BILLY. "Would you mind if I waited for her . . . here?"
VIOLET. "Naturally not."
BILLY. "Might I . . . _sit_?" (_Goes to step forward from doorway-and his coat is snagged on frame [i.e.: Someone Backstage holds onto end of it till his release]-and he ends up leaning forward and swaying like a loose ship's figurehead._)
VIOLET. (_With eyes demurely downcast, has not seen._) "If you are so _inclined_!" (_Looks up, sees him, gapes._)
BILLY. (_Abruptly frees coat [let it go, here], lurches sofa-ward, sprawls across right arm of sofa and lands with his face in _VIOLET'S _lap; he raises his head for:_) "Diana-"
VIOLET. "Yes, Stephen-?"
BILLY. "Would you take offense if I were to-to-?"
VIOLET. "Stephen, what are you trying to say?"
BILLY. (_Will squirm into sitting position beside her, during:_) "Oh, dash it all, Diana, must we play at words?! You _know _the message that longs to cry out from within my heart!"
VIOLET. "Is it possible-do I dare for a moment imagine-that the message in your heart is the selfsame message that cries out from within my own?" (_Then she looks down, reacts to what she sees, and-if delivering that message-whispers hoarsely:_) Your _fly _is open!
BILLY. (_Frantically claps both hands onto his lap, and in his panic jumps two speeches ahead._) "And yet -you do not draw away . . . ?"
[Once more, we go to pre-tape speed-up, strobe, and slow curtain, during: ]
VIOLET. "Oh, Stephen-can you not reason out why?!"
-82-
BILLY. "I-I am almost afraid to!"
VIOLET. "Then _cease _your noble trepidations, Stephen Sellers. For-though I am a high-born lady-I am also a woman!"
BILLY. "Oh, Diana!" (_Kisses her lightly-and fast, with the speed-up-on the lips._)
VIOLET. "Oh, Stephen!" (_They kiss again, and the CURTAIN IS CLOSED, now as we hear _an accelerating _speed-up alternation of "Oh-Diana-Oh-Stephen-Oh-Diana-Oh-Stephen-[etc.]" until the pitch is higher than _bats _or _dogs _could hear it, and then MUSIC STARTS, and we hear.-]_
AGGIE. (_Off. Normal speed and voice._) Everybody ready for Act Three! Places! Places!
GERRY. (_Off._) You know, Aggie, maybe I _should _have gone to that bar, after all!
AGGIE. (Off.) If you change your mind, I'll _join _you! The Paratroops was never like _this!_
LOUISE. (Off.) You know the difference between a play and a parachute?
AGGIE. (_Off . Warily._) What, Louise?
LOUISE. (_Off._) When _a parachute _opens, you have nothing to _worry _about! (AGGIE _and _GERRY _groan._)
GERRY. (_Off._) Oh, open the damned curtain!
(_CURTAIN OPENS as MUSIC STOPS, on final-act tableau._)
VIOLET. "Ah, Lord Dudley, you give the most charming parties in the whole of England!"
HENRY. "You are too kind, Diana. A pity Sir Percival could not be here."
POLLY. "Do you know-I'm _worried _about Percival! He's never accepted an invitation to one of our parties and then not shown up-at least, not without sending word."
-83-
BILLY. "Ah, but Lady Margaret, he might have had motor trouble."
VIOLET. "Yes, indeed. I do hope _he _hasn't had-" Uh. "-I do hope he _hasn't _had-hasn't _had_-had an _accident_!" (OTHER PLAYERS, _who had tensed during her struggle, now relax, and are taken unawares by her Freudian slip:_) "These words can be treacherous at night . . . _roads!"_
POLLY. "Don't say such a thing! It would make one think that perhaps there was some truth, after all, in that story about the curse!"
HENRY. "Nonsense, my dear. There's no such thurng as a keest-king as a thirst_-thing-as-a-curse!"_
BILLY. "And yet-everyone who has ever owned the-Darjeeling Diamond-has always met with a deadful dremise!"
(_PHYLLIS gives an angry grunt of frustration._)
VIOLET. (_Determined not to make an error again._) "But Percival doesn't own the _di_-a-mond anymore-not since he sold it to Lord Dudley for Lady Margaret's col-_lec_-tion." (_Sinks back in armchair with sigh of relief._)
SAUL. "Nevertheless-" (_It is _slightly _"neverthe_lesh," _and he is over-enunciating just enough so that our suspicions match those of :_)
GERRY. (Off.) Has Saul been taking a nip between acts?!
LOUISE. (Off.) Wouldn't you?
SAUL. (_Has taken a dramatic pause, now continues :_) "-Percival _did _own it-and that mi' be uh-nuff!" (_Smiles dopily and sways ever-so-slightly._)
BILLY. "See here, Doctor Forbes-you are a man of science-soorly _you_ don't believe in curshes?"
AGGIE. (_Off._) Louise! Has _Billy-?_
-84-
LOUISE. (_Off._) Saul hates to drink alone.
GERRY. (_Off._) Oh, dear God!
SAUL. "I only know there are strange things in the hishry of Inja-things which defy rashnul esplanation."
(NOTE: At _no time _will SAUL or BILLY actually stagger, stumble, or sway beyond the merest _slight _rocking-in-place; they are not falling-down drunk; they merely find the world a warm, funny and fuzzy place to be, and are pleased by this sensation.)
HENRY. "Nonsense. Sheer cockycock. Superstitious dribble!"
SAUL. "Quite posply, Lordudley-an' yet--"
POLLY. "And yet-?"
SAUL. (_Holds up a finger as if to speak, then peers around the room a second, then says with deep significance_:) "_Where _is Sir Percival?"
VIOLET. "Frankly, I'm _glad _he's not here!"
POLLY. "Why, Diana, what a thing to say!"
SAUL. Yes, indeedy!
BILLY. I'll say! (_BOTH smile inanely at one another._)
VIOLET. (_A little staggered by their improvisations._) "I mean it. Sir Percival is-no gentleman."
HENRY. "Here, now, what are you saying?"
VIOLET. (_Obviously with her mind elsewhere than on her line._) "When he looks at me-I feel as though my hands were moving all over his body."
PHYLLIS. (_Just audible._) Oh, dear. Oh, dear-oh-dear!
POLLY. (_Has almost laughed at _VIOLET'S _line, but manages to force her line out amid near-convulsive twitches from the mirth bubbling up and trying to escape her lips._) "But he is a knight of the _prrzztt_!" (_This last is a laugh raspberrying through pursed lips._)
-85-
VIOLET. (_At sea, since she didn't hear her own line at all._) "He is a disgusting toad. And such toads can be lecherous at night!"
(_SMITTY hastens Onstage on cue, but must wait her line for:_)
SAUL. Yes, indeedy!
BILLY. I'll say! (_Same smile-business at one another._)
SMITTY. (_Slightly shaken._) "Begging your pardon, milord, but should we delay dinner any? Longer?"
HENRY. "Mmm-no, I think not. Can't wait for Percival forever." (_Moves toward _POLLY.) "Shall we, my dear?"
POLLY. "I suppose so. But-don't you think someone should call Percival's flat and ascertain the reason for his absence?"
BILLY. (_Moves around _VIOLET'S _chair to take her arm as she rises, but _she _takes _his arm _to steady him._) "Do you know-that might be a sound idea. There is something distinctly odd about all of this."
VIOLET. "All of what, Stephen?"
BILLY. "This business about Percival and the neckulace. _Neck_ulace. He _did _say he was bringing it tonight, Lady Margaret?"
POLLY. "Well, actually, I never spoke with him directly-but there was a message delivered this morning on the post-_in_ the post-_on_ the post-the _mailman _brought it!"
SMITTY. (_Fuddled by the reworded cue._) "What, on Swithin's Day? . . . _Saint _Swithins! . . . Day!"
HENRY. "By Jove! Never thought of that! Margaret -are you _certain _about that-uh-that mailman-or whatever you said."
POLLY. "Why-come to think of it-no."
VIOLET. (_Trying to follow the alterations._) "You _didn't _receive a mailman?"
-86-
POLLY. Message!
VIOLET. That, too.
POLLY. "Oh, yes-I did-but now I wonder if it were actually from Percival !"
BILLY. "But it did come on a post?"
POLLY. "I-I assumed it had-but-"
HENRY. "Assumed? You mean, you didn't actually see it-him-the message _or _the mailman?"
POLLY. _Whatever _it was-_no_!
VIOLET. "Then how do you know it's con_tent?"_
POLLY. "Why-Doctor Forbes told me what it had said."
SAUL. Yes, indeedy!
BILLY. (_The soberer of the two, sees that _SAUL _is not about to give him his cue, so reverses his line to his own:_) Is there any _reason _why you _shouldn't _have? 
SAUL. (_Altered._) "Is there any reason I shouldnt have?"
BILLY. "No, no, of course not, old chap. Only-"
SAUL. (_Interrupts._) Then why'd you ask?
BILLY. (_Getting a grip on himself_.) "_On-ly . . . _if there was no delivery of the post, today, then how-"
SAUL. "It was not a letter. It was a telephone. Cable-car. _Telegram_!" (_Aware of his own inadequacies for the first time, he is starting to regain some control._) BILLY. "I should like very much to _see _that telegram!"
SAUL. (_Starts searching pockets, takes out pistol, shakes his head, replaces pistol, then remembers:_) Hey! I haven't got it! . . . uh . . . "As a matter of fact. The message was phoned from the telegraph office."
BILLY. "Doris-have there been any telephone messages this evening?"
SAUL. "See here, you innocent young punk! Are you doubting my word?!"
-87-
POLLY. "Of course he isn't, Rex! . ." (_Goes "up."_) "Of course he isn't, Rex . . ."
AGGIE. (_Off. Cuing with next word._) "Stephen-"
POLLY. (_Thinking she's flubbed the name._) "Of course he isn't, Stephen!"
BILLY. (_Helpfully._) Should I apologize to Doctor Forbes?
POLLY. (_Sincerely._) Yes, thank you!
BILLY. "Oh, I shall. As soon as-as-"
SMITTY. I'm _Doris._
BILLY. "-Doris answers my question."
SMITTY. (_Got lost while helping_.) . . . What was the question?
(_PLAYERS all look desperately at one another._)
POLLY. _Someone _must remember!
SAUL. (_Almost sober, now, but just as lost as the _rest.) Damned if _I _do!
VIOLET. Me, neither!
HENRY. Doesn't _anyone _know?
SMITTY. (_Suddenly remembers her line._) "No, sir!"
BILLY. No, _what?_
SMITTY. That's the answer to the _question!_
POLLY. (_Without thinking, says the right line by accident:_) What, are you quite sure?
SMITTY. "The telephone has been out of order since this afternoon: _Mum!"_
BILLY. "Aha! And what do you say to _that, _Doctor Forbes?"
(_Silence; PLAYERS covertly look toward phone, and we hear galloping FOOTSTEPS Backstage, and:_)
AGGIE. (_Off._) Oh, damn it!
(_PHONE RINGS._)
-88-
SAUL. "Does _that _answer your question?"
POLLY. "Stephen, I believe you owe Doctor Forbes an apology."
(_PHONE RINGS AGAIN._)
HENRY. "You had best answer that, Doris . . ."
SMITTY. (_Hesitates, reverse-feeds him his incompleted line._) Before we owe the _caller _an apology, too?
HENRY. (_Anything to get to the final curtain._) Yes, damn it, yes!
SMITTY. (_Leaps to phone._) Yes, sir, you bet! (_Grabs it up, and in her anxiety forgets to pause for the supposed caller's part of the dialogue with her._) "Hello? Who? Why, yes, he is. Just a moment." (_Thrusts phone at _HENRY.) It's for you. (_Starts away, turns swiftly back._) Sir! (_Moves away._)
HENRY. (_Flustered, forgets his line to _SMITTY, _speaks right on phone._) "Hello? . . . What? . . ." (_Then remembers, goes wide-eyed, shouts after _SMITTY.) "Who is it, Doris?"
SMITTY. "Sir Percival."
(_Before _SAUL _can say his line, a confused _HENRY _gets right back on phone, with :_)
HENRY. "Ah! Yes, I see . . . Yes, thank you! Thank you very much!"
SAUL. (_Better late than never._) "It _can't _be! . . I mean-"
HENRY. (_So shaken, he sets phone down on stand beside cradle._) You mean it can't be _Sir Percival, _right?
SAUL. Uh. Right!
BILLY. (_Dismally plunges into his own line_.) "_Yes, _Doctor? Exactly what _do _you mean?"
SAUL. "Why-I-I-"
-89-
(_PLAYERS look at _HENRY, _since it is _now _he is supposed to go to the phone, but of course he's already been there._)
HENRY. Uh-I'm _off _the phone, Polly_-Margaret!_
POLLY. Off the-? But-? Oh! "Why-Dudley-you-look-so-strange-what-did-Percival-say?"
HENRY. (_Relieved to be back on the track._) "That was _not _Sir Percival!"
POLLY. "Then-who was it?"
BILLY. (_Calmly._) "That was-" (_Less calmly_.) "-_uh-a _good friend of mine . ." (_Sincerely._) I can't quite remember his name!
SAUL. (_Helpfully._) Miles Taylor!
BILLY. Right!
VIOLET. "Stephen, I do not understand."
POLLY. "Nor I."
BILLY. (_Still panicky, skips eight speeches_.) "_I _can explain what it means! It means that this man, after murdering Sir Percival for the necklace-" (_Half-realizes.._) Did-did I say he was struck -dumfounded?
HENRY. (_Trying to help, but just as lost._) "I saw - observed-the selfsame reaction-I think."
SMITTY. (_When OTHER WOMEN stand there, lost, skips their lines._) "Yes, what can it _possibly _mean?"
HENRY. (_Joyful to recognize a cue, jumps _in:) "Doris, you are forgetting your place!"
AGGIE. (_Off._) _She's _not the _only _one!
GERRY. (_Off_.) Where the hell _are _they?
AGGIE. (_Off_.) Search _me!_
(_PLAYERS have heard, and reacted, and look very forlorn to realize they're unlikely to be prompted._)
HENRY. (_For want of something better, repeats._) `Doris, you are forgetting your place!"
SAUL. (_The scene seems familiar, so he comes in, not realizing he's skipped _BILLY'S _accusation, so that it now sounds as if he's chiding _HENRY.) "How dare you, sir! I'll have you in court for this! Such accusations are actionable! To tarnish my good name-it's libelous!"
-90-
PHYLLIS. (_Jumps to her feet._) Oh! Oh, dear! (_Turns and rushes frantically up aisle to get Backstage_.)
BILLY. (_Has paused and squinted out into theatre to seek the source of the disturbance, gives it up, and:_) "I cannot be sued successfully for libel if my accusations should prove true!"
SAUL. (_Sneers._) "And just how do you _intend _to prove them true?"
BILLY. "Quite easily, after a look at that necklace. Would you mind getting it, Doctor Forbes-?"
SAUL. "The necklace? There is no proof on that necklace. I'll show you!" (_Goes to safe, dials combination, reaches inside-and his face goes ghastly when he finds nothing._) Uh-I'm _sure it's _in here _someplace_! . . . (_Removes his hand from safe, and we can hear-but he doesn't-FOOTFALLS Backstage as _PHYLLIS _arrives._) Are-are you sure that's where you put it-Margaret-?
POLLY. (_Not much good at ad-libbing, does a large shrug._) Like, where _else?!_
BILLY. Uh-why don't you have another look?
SAUL. Oh, all right! (_Turns, opens half-closed safe door-and out comes _PHYLLIS'S _hand, holding the necklace, to the elbow; he slumps, but takes it, waits till her hand is withdrawn, then slams safe door and turns._) "There! Now show me your ridiculous proof!"
BILLY. "You yourself have shown the proof, Doctor Forbes! For-if you are _not _the murderer-how did you know the combination to that _safe?!"_
POLLY. "Great heavens! He's right!"
SAUL. "Blast you, Stephen Sellers!" (_Tries to whip out pistol-it is snagged in his pocket._) "But there- there is one thing-you did not-did not take into account-!" (_And with a RIPPING NOISE, pistol comes out, half a pocket-lining dangling from the barrel._) "I am armed!"
-91-
HENRY. "You, sir, are a scoundrel !"
VIOLET. "And I should very much like to sunder our engagement this moment!"
BILLY. "In that case-will you marry _me, _Violet?"
VIOLET. (_Overjoyed._) Oh, Billy! (_Flings her arms around him._)
BILLY. (_Terrified._) I mean _"Diana"!_
VIOLET. (_Releases him._) Oh, darn! (_Remembers it's her line, grabs his hands._) "With all my heart, Stephen!"
POLLY. "Doris-telephone at once for the constabulary!"
SAUL. (_Finally manages to get pocket-lining off pistol._) "Do so and you are dead, my dear!"
SMITTY. "Oh, mum, what shall I do?"
SAUL. "Just raise your hands. And the rest of you do likewise!"
(_PHYLLIS will come down aisle and regain her seat, during :_)
HENRY. (_Wondering why the phone didn't ring, but not looking at it._) Did you say- (_Loudly, toward _AGGIE _Backstage:_) "And the rest of you do likewise!"?
AGGIE. (_Off. Hoarse whisper._) Hang up the phone!
(HENRY _looks blankly into his empty palm, dazed._)
GERRY & AGGIE. (_Off. A bit louder than a whisper._) Hang up the phone!
(_All PLAYERS save SA-cm-since they are all facing away from the phone-now look similarly into their empty palms, just as dazed as _HENRY; SAUL _suddenly sees, beyond them, what the problem is, and finds himself in a trio, on:_)
-92-
SAUL, GERRY & AGGIE. (_Off. A very audible shout_.) _Hang up the phone_!
(_SMITTY turns, quickly hangs it up, and no sooner is receiver back into cradle than PHONE RINGS._)
SAUL. "Damn and blast! Who's that?!"
BILLY. "It is my friend, Miles Taylor. I told him to ring us back shortly after his first call. If I do not answer-he shall summon the law, and they shall arrive here with a warrant for your arrest--Stanley Grimes!"
(NOTE: We are about to "cheat" a bit; your audience has already heard the finale-to-the-inner-play in its entirety, but unless they have memories like a computer, they won't notice that we are about to shorten that ending quite a bit, to get to the real ending of the real show. So here is how the inner-play finish goes from here on: )
POLLY & VIOLET. "Stanley Grimes!"
BILLY. "So put down that pistol and surrender!"
SAUL. "Never! I shall take this necklace, sell it for a fortune, and move wealthily to another country!"
(_We hear POLICE SIRENS nearing, outside French doors._)
POLLY. "Oh, curse you, Stanley Grimes!"
SAUL. (_Clutches his heart._) "Oh! Oh! Oh!"
POLLY. "It's the curse! The curse of the Delhi Diamond !"
-93-
VIOLET. Ranchipur Diamond!
BILLY. Darjeeling Diamond!
HENRY. (_Disgusted with the whole thing_.) _All _of _them_! (_Moves to _SAUL, _lifts his wrist, but _SAUL _has not dropped the gun this time, and it FIRES; _HENRY _jumps a foot away._)
POLLY. (_Who has raised her forefinger to say her actual line, has reacted at the same time, and instead says_:) _What the hell was that?!_
(_CURTAIN CLOSES SWIFTLY, MUSIC COMES UP, and _PHYLLIS _jumps to her feet, applauding._)
PHYLLIS. Author! Author!
(_CURTAINS OPEN, and we see frazzled PLAYERS not _quite _in curtain-call position, but they quickly get into it and start bowing [with _PHYLLIS _leading applause, your audience should be applauding, now, too], then gesture wing-ward, and _GERRY _comes smilingly Onstage to Center, taking a bow herself, and then _ALL _gesture to _PHYLLIS, _who gaily trots to stage, and gets up on it, and _GERRY _graciously moves back to end of lined-up-PLAYERS to allow _PHYLLIS _Center Stage-and _PHYLLIS _reaches into her evening bag, takes out a folded sheaf of paper, opens it, and holds out her hands to "shush" applause, then holds paper before her, clears her throat, and:]_
PHYLLIS. (_Reading from paper._) My dear friends and fellow theatre-lovers-I cannot thank you enough for the warm reception you have given my modest effort here tonight-but _I would _like to take this opportunity to discuss with you the state of the theatre in America today-

(_PLAYERS and _GERRY _are looking at her, aghast, and then all smile as PHYLLIS_-her _lips still moving in unheard speech- is quite drowned out by VIOLENT THUNDERSTORM SOUND-EFFECTS [the CRACKLE-BAM-CRACKLE_BOOM-CRACKLE-BLAM _sort that goes on without any silent intervals]; after a moment, _PHYLLIS'S _lips stop moving, and she looks up and about and around in bewilderment-as _LOUISE _steps just fractionally Onstage, and extends her hand, and _GERRY _is already moving to her with _a _dollar bill, which she places in her hand, and _LOUISE _smiles, pocketing it, and PLAYERS laugh in merriment and hang onto each other with the giddiness of their glee, and _PHYLLIS _jams her fists against her hips, her face twisted in chagrin, and as THUNDERSTORM continues unabated_)
(_THE CURTAIN FALLS_)
(NOTE: Waste no time here in doing your _real _curtain-call, opening curtain-over MUSIC-to an empty stage, and having ALL PLAYERS (re-member, this includes AGGIE, GERRY, LOUISE and PHYLLIS, now) come out from opposite sides in pairs-one from right doorway, one from French doors-meet at Center, bow, spread apart so next couple can enter and do same, etc., till all ten stalwarts have earned their _real _kudos from your audience.)
