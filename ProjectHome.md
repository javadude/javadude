Hi! I'm Scott Stanchfield.

Welcome to my little home on Google Code!
This is where I'm hosting my latest tools and source code for the world to chew on.

My main home page is http://javadude.com.

Here I'm hosting

  * **ANTXR** - The world's coolest java XML Parser
  * **JavaDude Dynamic Working Sets** - auto-managed working sets based on regular expressions or project natures
  * **JavaBean (and other) annotations** - nifty Java annotations that generate all that boilerplate bean code, and some other niceties
  * **Miscellaneous eclipse plugins** - other plugins I'm working on

NOTE: The docs on this site are very much a work in progress (and I haven't had a ton of time to work on them.) If you have any questions, feel free to email me at scott@javadude.com. Please include `[tools]` in your header -- much more likely to stand out among the spam...
